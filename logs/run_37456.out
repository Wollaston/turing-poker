The framework should consider the following factors:\n- The player\'s hand strength and potential\n- The community board\'s strength and potential\n- The current street and the number of cards remaining to be dealt\n- The player\'s personality and willingness to take risks\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\nThe assistant\'s response will be evaluated based on the correctness of the action and the quality of the reasoning provided. The assistant should clearly explain their thought process and provide a logical justification for their action.'

The action should be one of the following:\n- "call"\n- "raise"\n- "fold"\n- "all-in"\n\n## Domain-Specific Factual Information\n- In Poker, a "straight draw" refers to a hand that has a chance to become a straight with the community cards.\n- A "flush draw" refers to a hand that has a chance to become a flush with the community cards.\n- A "pair" refers to two cards of the same rank.\n- A "strong hand" is a hand that has a high chance of winning, such as a pair of high-ranking cards or a straight.\n- A "tight player" is a player who plays conservatively and only bets when they have a strong hand.\n- An "aggressive player" is a player who plays aggressively and bets frequently.\n- A "thirty-five_percent player" is a player who plays relatively tight and only bets when they have a strong hand, but also has a moderate level of aggression.\n\n## Generalizable Strategy\nThe assistant may use a generalizable strategy to determine the best action, such as:\n- Evaluating the strength of the player\'s hand and the community cards.\n- Considering the player\'s personality and adjusting the strategy accordingly.\n- Weighing the potential risks and rewards of each action.\n- Using a decision tree or other algorithm to determine the best action.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\nThe assistant\'s responses will be evaluated based on the following criteria:\n- Accuracy: Is the determined action correct?\n- Reasoning: Is the reasoning provided clear and concise?\n- Adaptability: Does the assistant adjust its strategy based on the player\'s personality and the current state of the game?\n- Generalizability: Does the assistant use a generalizable strategy that can be applied to a wide range of situations?\n\n## Additional Requirements\n- The assistant should be able to handle different types of player personalities, including tight, aggressive, and thirty-five_percent players.\n- The assistant should be able to evaluate the strength of the player\'s hand and the community cards, including the presence of straight draws, flush draws, and pairs.\n- The assistant should be able to weigh the potential risks and rewards of each action, including the potential for losing chips or winning the pot.\n- The assistant should be able to use a decision tree or other algorithm to determine the best action, taking into account the player\'s personality and the current state of the game.\n\n## Example Inputs and Outputs\nThe following are examples of different task inputs provided to the assistant along with the assistant\'s response for each of them, and some feedback on how the assistant\'s response could be better:\n\n# Example 1\n## Inputs\n### personality\nthirty_five_percent\n\n### hole_cards\n(6s, 2h)\n\n### board\n()\n\n### street\nPreflop\n\n## Generated Outputs\n### reasoning\nAs a thirty-five_percent player, I should be playing relatively tight and only betting when I have a strong hand. Since it\'s preflop and the board is empty, I don\'t have much information about the community cards. My hand is a 6s and a 2h, which is not a strong starting hand. I should be cautious and call to see the flop.\n\n### action\ncall\n\n## Feedback\nYou made the correct \'call\' action for this hand and board. This correct action is indeed \'call.\'\n\n# Example 2\n## Inputs\n### personality\naggressive\n\n### hole_cards\n(8d, 5h)\n\n### board\n()\n\n### street\nPreflop\n\n## Generated Outputs\n### reasoning\nAs an aggressive player, I should be playing aggressively and betting frequently. Given that we are in the preflop stage and the board is empty, I should be raising with strong hands to build the pot. My hand (8d, 5h) is not strong enough to justify a raise, but I will still raise to put pressure on my opponents.\n\n### action\nraise\n\n## Feedback\nYou made the correct \'raise\' action for this hand and board. This correct action is indeed \'raise.\'\n\n# Example 3\n## Inputs\n### personality\ntight\n\n### hole_cards\n(6s, 5h)\n\n### board\n()\n\n### street\nPreflop\n\n## Generated Outputs\n### reasoning\nAs a tight player, I should be playing conservatively and only betting when I have a strong hand. Since it\'s preflop and the board is empty, I don\'t have much information about the community cards. My hand is a 6s and 5h, which is not a strong starting hand.

The action should be one of the following:\n- "call"\n- "raise"\n- "fold"\n- "all-in"\n\n## Domain-Specific Factual Information\n- In Poker, a "straight draw" refers to a hand that has a chance to become a straight with the community cards.\n- A "flush draw" refers to a hand that has a chance to become a flush with the community cards.\n- A "pair" refers to two cards of the same rank.\n- A "strong hand" is a hand that has a high chance of winning, such as a pair of high-ranking cards or a straight.\n- A "tight player" is a player who plays conservatively and only bets when they have a strong hand.\n- An "aggressive player" is a player who plays aggressively and bets frequently.\n- A "thirty-five_percent player" is a player who plays relatively tight and only bets when they have a strong hand, but also has a moderate level of aggression.\n\n## Generalizable Strategy\nThe assistant may use a generalizable strategy to determine the best action, such as:\n- Evaluating the strength of the player\'s hand and the community cards.\n- Considering the player\'s personality and adjusting the strategy accordingly.\n- Weighing the potential risks and rewards of each action.\n- Using a decision tree or other algorithm to determine the best action.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\nThe assistant\'s responses will be evaluated based on the following criteria:\n- Accuracy: Is the determined action correct?\n- Reasoning: Is the reasoning provided clear and concise?\n- Adaptability: Does the assistant adjust its strategy based on the player\'s personality and the current state of the game?\n- Generalizability: Does the assistant use a generalizable strategy that can be applied to a wide range of situations?\n\n## Additional Requirements\n- The assistant should be able to handle different types of player personalities, including tight, aggressive, and thirty-five_percent players.\n- The assistant should be able to evaluate the strength of the player\'s hand and the community cards, including the presence of straight draws, flush draws, and pairs.\n- The assistant should be able to weigh the potential risks and rewards of each action, including the potential for losing chips or winning the pot.\n- The assistant should be able to use a decision tree or other algorithm to determine the best action, taking into account the player\'s personality and the current state of the game.\n\n## Example Inputs and Outputs\nThe following are examples of different task inputs provided to the assistant along with the assistant\'s response for each of them, and some feedback on how the assistant\'s response could be better:\n\n# Example 1\n## Inputs\n### personality\nthirty_five_percent\n\n### hole_cards\n(6s, 2h)\n\n### board\n()\n\n### street\nPreflop\n\n## Generated Outputs\n### reasoning\nAs a thirty-five_percent player, I should be playing relatively tight and only betting when I have a strong hand. Since it\'s preflop and the board is empty, I don\'t have much information about the community cards. My hand is a 6s and a 2h, which is not a strong starting hand. I should be cautious and call to see the flop.\n\n### action\ncall\n\n## Feedback\nYou made the correct \'call\' action for this hand and board.

Given that we are in the preflop stage and the board is empty, I should be raising with strong hands to build the pot. My hand (8d, 5h) is not strong enough to justify a raise, but I will still raise to put pressure on my opponents.\n\n### action\nraise\n\n## Feedback\nYou made the correct \'raise\' action for this hand and board.

    instructions='python\n# Task Instruction\n\n## Task Description\nThe task is to determine the best action for a given Poker Hand, considering the hole cards, the board, and the current street.\n\n## Input Format\nThe input will be in the following format:\n- `personality`: A string representing the personality of the player, which may affect their decision-making style.\n- `hole_cards`: A tuple of two strings representing the player\'s hole cards, each in the format of a two-character string (e.g., "Kh" for King of Hearts).\n- `board`: A tuple of five strings representing the community cards on the board, each in the format of a two-character string.\n- `street`: A string representing the current street of the game, which can be one of "Pre-Flop", "Flop", "Turn", or "River".\n\n## Task Requirements\nThe task requires the assistant to:\n1. Analyze the hole cards and the board to determine the strength of the player\'s hand.\n2. Consider the possible actions of the opponent and the player\'s own hand strength to determine the best course of action.\n3. Choose an action from the following options: "raise", "call", "check", "fold", or "bet".\n\n## Domain-Specific Factual Information\n- A "set" is a hand with three cards of the same rank, and it is a strong hand.\n- A "flush" is a hand with five cards of the same suit, and it is a very strong hand.\n- A "straight" is a hand with five cards of sequential rank, and it is a strong hand.\n- A "pair" is a hand with two cards of the same rank, and it is a relatively strong hand.\n- A "draw" is a situation where the player has a chance to improve their hand by improving the board.\n- The player\'s personality may affect their decision-making style, with more aggressive players being more likely to raise and less aggressive players being more likely to fold.\n- A "top pair" is a hand with a pair of the highest rank on the board, and it is a relatively strong hand.\n- A "bottom pair" is a hand with a pair of the lowest rank on the board, and it is a relatively weak hand.\n- A "kicker" is a card that breaks a tie between two or more hands with the same rank, and it is an important factor in determining the strength of a hand.\n\n## Generalizable Strategy\nThe assistant may use a generalizable strategy to solve the task, such as:\n1. Evaluating the strength of the player\'s hand based on the hole cards and the board.\n2. Considering the possible actions of the opponent and the player\'s own hand strength to determine the best course of action.\n3. Using a decision tree or a probability model to determine the best action based on the player\'s hand strength and the opponent\'s possible actions.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\nThe assistant\'s responses will be evaluated based on the following criteria:\n1. Accuracy: The assistant\'s response should accurately reflect the best action for the given Poker Hand.\n2. Reasoning: The assistant\'s response should provide a clear and logical explanation for their decision.\n3. Domain knowledge: The assistant\'s response should demonstrate a good understanding of Poker Hand strength and the possible actions of the opponent.\n\n## Additional Requirements\nThe assistant should be able to handle the following scenarios:\n- A player has a strong hand and should raise to maximize their winnings.\n- A player has a weak hand and should fold to minimize their losses.\n- A player has a draw and should call to see the next card and reassess the situation.\n- A player has a top pair and should bet to protect their hand.\n- A player has a bottom pair and should check to minimize their losses.\n\n## Example Inputs and Outputs\nThe following are examples of different task inputs provided to the assistant along with the assistant\'s response for each of them, and some feedback on how the assistant\'s response could be better:\n```python\n# Example 1\n## Inputs\n### personality\nthirty_five_percent\n\n### hole_cards\n(3h, 7s)\n\n### board\n(Qs, Jh, 3s)\n\n### street\nFlop\n\n## Generated Outputs\n### reasoning\nThe player has a pair of 3s, which is a relatively strong hand. However, the board also has a Queen and a Jack, which could be part of a stronger hand. Considering the Flop street, it\'s likely that the opponent has a stronger hand, so the player should be cautious. Given the player\'s personality is thirty-five percent, which suggests a somewhat cautious approach, the best action would be to call to see the next card and reassess the situation.\n\n### action\ncall\n\n## Feedback\nYou made the correct \'call\' action for this hand and board. This correct action is indeed \'call\'.\n\n# Example 2\n## Inputs\n### personality\nthirty_five_percent\n\n### hole_cards\n(Qd, 6d)\n\n### board\n(9h, 8c, 3c)\n\n### street\nFlop\n\n## Generated Outputs\n### reasoning\nBased on the given hole cards (Qd, 6d) and the board (9h, 8c, 3c), we are in a draw situation. The player has a possible straight draw with the Queen and the 6, but it\'s not yet a strong hand. Considering the personality of the player, who is thirty-five percent aggressive, we should be cautious and not overplay our hand. The flop is not yet a strong board for the player, so we should aim to conserve our chips and wait for a better opportunity to act.\n\n### action\ncheck\n\n## Feedback\nYou made the correct \'check\' action for this hand and board. This correct action is indeed \'check\'.\n\n# Example 3\n## Inputs\n### personality\nthirty_five_percent\n\n### hole_cards\n(Qd, 8c)\n\n### board\n(Qh, 8h, 6h)\n\n### street\nFlop\n\n## Generated Outputs\n### reasoning\nBased on the given hole cards (Qd, 8c) and the board (Qh, 8h, 6h), it appears that the player has a pair of eights, which is a relatively strong hand. However, the board also has a queen, which could be a threat to the player\'s hand. Considering the current street is the Flop, the player has a chance to improve their hand by improving the board. Given the player\'s personality is thirty-five percent, which suggests a relatively cautious approach, the player should aim to minimize their losses while still trying to improve their hand.\n\n### action\nraise\n\n## Feedback\nYou made the correct \'raise\' action for this hand and board. This correct action is indeed \'raise\'.'

This correct action is indeed \'call\'.\n\n# Example 2\n## Inputs\n### personality\nthirty_five_percent\n\n### hole_cards\n(Qd, 6d)\n\n### board\n(9h, 8c, 3c)\n\n### street\nFlop\n\n## Generated Outputs\n### reasoning\nBased on the given hole cards (Qd, 6d) and the board (9h, 8c, 3c), we are in a draw situation. The player has a possible straight draw with the Queen and the 6, but it\'s not yet a strong hand. Considering the personality of the player, who is thirty-five percent aggressive, we should be cautious and not overplay our hand. The flop is not yet a strong board for the player, so we should aim to conserve our chips and wait for a better opportunity to act.\n\n### action\ncheck\n\n## Feedback\nYou made the correct \'check\' action for this hand and board. This correct action is indeed \'check\'.\n\n# Example 3\n## Inputs\n### personality\nthirty_five_percent\n\n### hole_cards\n(Qd, 8c)\n\n### board\n(Qh, 8h, 6h)\n\n### street\nFlop\n\n## Generated Outputs\n### reasoning\nBased on the given hole cards (Qd, 8c) and the board (Qh, 8h, 6h), it appears that the player has a pair of eights, which is a relatively strong hand. However, the board also has a queen, which could be a threat to the player\'s hand. Considering the current street is the Flop, the player has a chance to improve their hand by improving the board. Given the player\'s personality is thirty-five percent, which suggests a relatively cautious approach, the player should aim to minimize their losses while still trying to improve their hand.\n\n### action\nraise\n\n## Feedback\nYou made the correct \'raise\' action for this hand and board. This correct action is indeed \'raise\'.'

Analyze the hole cards and the board to determine the strength of the player\'s hand.\n2. Consider the possible actions of the opponent and the player\'s own hand strength to determine the best course of action.\n3. Choose an action from the following options: "raise", "call", "check", "fold", or "bet".\n\n## Domain-Specific Factual Information\n- A "set" is a hand with three cards of the same rank, and it is a strong hand.\n- A "flush" is a hand with five cards of the same suit, and it is a very strong hand.\n- A "straight" is a hand with five cards of sequential rank, and it is a strong hand.\n- A "pair" is a hand with two cards of the same rank, and it is a relatively strong hand.\n- A "draw" is a situation where the player has a chance to improve their hand by improving the board.\n- The player\'s personality may affect their decision-making style, with more aggressive players being more likely to raise and less aggressive players being more likely to fold.\n- A "top pair" is a hand with a pair of the highest rank on the board, and it is a relatively strong hand.\n- A "bottom pair" is a hand with a pair of the lowest rank on the board, and it is a relatively weak hand.\n- A "kicker" is a card that breaks a tie between two or more hands with the same rank, and it is an important factor in determining the strength of a hand.\n\n## Generalizable Strategy\nThe assistant may use a generalizable strategy to solve the task, such as:\n1. Evaluating the strength of the player\'s hand based on the hole cards and the board.\n2. Considering the possible actions of the opponent and the player\'s own hand strength to determine the best course of action.\n3. Using a decision tree or a probability model to determine the best action based on the player\'s hand strength and the opponent\'s possible actions.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\nThe assistant\'s responses will be evaluated based on the following criteria:\n1. Accuracy: The assistant\'s response should accurately reflect the best action for the given Poker Hand.\n2. Reasoning: The assistant\'s response should provide a clear and logical explanation for their decision.\n3. Domain knowledge: The assistant\'s response should demonstrate a good understanding of Poker Hand strength and the possible actions of the opponent.\n\n## Additional Requirements\nThe assistant should be able to handle the following scenarios:\n- A player has a strong hand and should raise to maximize their winnings.\n- A player has a weak hand and should fold to minimize their losses.\n- A player has a draw and should call to see the next card and reassess the situation.\n- A player has a top pair and should bet to protect their hand.\n- A player has a bottom pair and should check to minimize their losses.\n\n## Example Inputs and Outputs\nThe following are examples of different task inputs provided to the assistant along with the assistant\'s response for each of them, and some feedback on how the assistant\'s response could be better:\n```python\n# Example 1\n## Inputs\n### personality\nthirty_five_percent\n\n### hole_cards\n(3h, 7s)\n\n### board\n(Qs, Jh, 3s)\n\n### street\nFlop\n\n## Generated Outputs\n### reasoning\nThe player has a pair of 3s, which is a relatively strong hand. However, the board also has a Queen and a Jack, which could be part of a stronger hand. Considering the Flop street, it\'s likely that the opponent has a stronger hand, so the player should be cautious. Given the player\'s personality is thirty-five percent, which suggests a somewhat cautious approach, the best action would be to call to see the next card and reassess the situation.\n\n### action\ncall\n\n## Feedback\nYou made the correct \'call\' action for this hand and board. This correct action is indeed \'call\'.\n\n# Example 2\n## Inputs\n### personality\nthirty_five_percent\n\n### hole_cards\n(Qd, 6d)\n\n### board\n(9h, 8c, 3c)\n\n### street\nFlop\n\n## Generated Outputs\n### reasoning\nBased on the given hole cards (Qd, 6d) and the board (9h, 8c, 3c), we are in a draw situation. The player has a possible straight draw with the Queen and the 6, but it\'s not yet a strong hand. Considering the personality of the player, who is thirty-five percent aggressive, we should be cautious and not overplay our hand. The flop is not yet a strong board for the player, so we should aim to conserve our chips and wait for a better opportunity to act.\n\n### action\ncheck\n\n## Feedback\nYou made the correct \'check\' action for this hand and board. This correct action is indeed \'check\'.\n\n# Example 3\n## Inputs\n### personality\nthirty_five_percent\n\n### hole_cards\n(Qd, 8c)\n\n### board\n(Qh, 8h, 6h)\n\n### street\nFlop\n\n## Generated Outputs\n### reasoning\nBased on the given hole cards (Qd, 8c) and the board (Qh, 8h, 6h), it appears that the player has a pair of eights, which is a relatively strong hand. However, the board also has a queen, which could be a threat to the player\'s hand. Considering the current street is the Flop, the player has a chance to improve their hand by improving the board. Given the player\'s personality is thirty-five percent, which suggests a relatively cautious approach, the player should aim to minimize their losses while still trying to improve their hand.\n\n### action\nraise\n\n## Feedback\nYou made the correct \'raise\' action for this hand and board. This correct action is indeed \'raise\'.'

Given that we are in the preflop stage and the board is empty, I should be raising with strong hands to build the pot. My hand (8d, 5h) is not strong enough to justify a raise, but I will still raise to put pressure on my opponents.\n\n### action\nraise\n\n## Feedback\nYou made the correct \'raise\' action for this hand and board.

Analyze the hole cards and the board to determine the strength of the player\'s hand.\n2. Consider the possible actions of the opponent and the player\'s own hand strength to determine the best course of action.\n3. Choose an action from the following options: "raise", "call", "check", "fold", or "bet".\n\n## Domain-Specific Factual Information\n- A "set" is a hand with three cards of the same rank, and it is a strong hand.\n- A "flush" is a hand with five cards of the same suit, and it is a very strong hand.\n- A "straight" is a hand with five cards of sequential rank, and it is a strong hand.\n- A "pair" is a hand with two cards of the same rank, and it is a relatively strong hand.\n- A "draw" is a situation where the player has a chance to improve their hand by improving the board.\n- The player\'s personality may affect their decision-making style, with more aggressive players being more likely to raise and less aggressive players being more likely to fold.\n- A "top pair" is a hand with a pair of the highest rank on the board, and it is a relatively strong hand.\n- A "bottom pair" is a hand with a pair of the lowest rank on the board, and it is a relatively weak hand.\n- A "kicker" is a card that breaks a tie between two or more hands with the same rank, and it is an important factor in determining the strength of a hand.\n\n## Generalizable Strategy\nThe assistant may use a generalizable strategy to solve the task, such as:\n1. Evaluating the strength of the player\'s hand based on the hole cards and the board.\n2. Considering the possible actions of the opponent and the player\'s own hand strength to determine the best course of action.\n3. Using a decision tree or a probability model to determine the best action based on the player\'s hand strength and the opponent\'s possible actions.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\nThe assistant\'s responses will be evaluated based on the following criteria:\n1. Accuracy: The assistant\'s response should accurately reflect the best action for the given Poker Hand.\n2. Reasoning: The assistant\'s response should provide a clear and logical explanation for their decision.\n3. Domain knowledge: The assistant\'s response should demonstrate a good understanding of Poker Hand strength and the possible actions of the opponent.\n\n## Additional Requirements\nThe assistant should be able to handle the following scenarios:\n- A player has a strong hand and should raise to maximize their winnings.\n- A player has a weak hand and should fold to minimize their losses.\n- A player has a draw and should call to see the next card and reassess the situation.\n- A player has a top pair and should bet to protect their hand.\n- A player has a bottom pair and should check to minimize their losses.\n\n## Example Inputs and Outputs\nThe following are examples of different task inputs provided to the assistant along with the assistant\'s response for each of them, and some feedback on how the assistant\'s response could be better:\n```python\n# Example 1\n## Inputs\n### personality\nthirty_five_percent\n\n### hole_cards\n(3h, 7s)\n\n### board\n(Qs, Jh, 3s)\n\n### street\nFlop\n\n## Generated Outputs\n### reasoning\nThe player has a pair of 3s, which is a relatively strong hand. However, the board also has a Queen and a Jack, which could be part of a stronger hand. Considering the Flop street, it\'s likely that the opponent has a stronger hand, so the player should be cautious. Given the player\'s personality is thirty-five percent, which suggests a somewhat cautious approach, the best action would be to call to see the next card and reassess the situation.\n\n### action\ncall\n\n## Feedback\nYou made the correct \'call\' action for this hand and board. This correct action is indeed \'call\'.\n\n# Example 2\n## Inputs\n### personality\nthirty_five_percent\n\n### hole_cards\n(Qd, 6d)\n\n### board\n(9h, 8c, 3c)\n\n### street\nFlop\n\n## Generated Outputs\n### reasoning\nBased on the given hole cards (Qd, 6d) and the board (9h, 8c, 3c), we are in a draw situation. The player has a possible straight draw with the Queen and the 6, but it\'s not yet a strong hand. Considering the personality of the player, who is thirty-five percent aggressive, we should be cautious and not overplay our hand. The flop is not yet a strong board for the player, so we should aim to conserve our chips and wait for a better opportunity to act.\n\n### action\ncheck\n\n## Feedback\nYou made the correct \'check\' action for this hand and board. This correct action is indeed \'check\'.\n\n# Example 3\n## Inputs\n### personality\nthirty_five_percent\n\n### hole_cards\n(Qd, 8c)\n\n### board\n(Qh, 8h, 6h)\n\n### street\nFlop\n\n## Generated Outputs\n### reasoning\nBased on the given hole cards (Qd, 8c) and the board (Qh, 8h, 6h), it appears that the player has a pair of eights, which is a relatively strong hand. However, the board also has a queen, which could be a threat to the player\'s hand. Considering the current street is the Flop, the player has a chance to improve their hand by improving the board. Given the player\'s personality is thirty-five percent, which suggests a relatively cautious approach, the player should aim to minimize their losses while still trying to improve their hand.\n\n### action\nraise\n\n## Feedback\nYou made the correct \'raise\' action for this hand and board.

This gives me a strong hand, but I need to consider the potential for a straight or flush draw. However, with a 6h in my hand, I don\'t have any cards that could complete a straight, and the board doesn\'t have any hearts that could complete a flush.

The action should be one of the following:\n- "call"\n- "raise"\n- "fold"\n- "all-in"\n\n## Domain-Specific Factual Information\n- In Poker, a "straight draw" refers to a hand that has a chance to become a straight with the community cards.\n- A "flush draw" refers to a hand that has a chance to become a flush with the community cards.\n- A "pair" refers to two cards of the same rank.\n- A "strong hand" is a hand that has a high chance of winning, such as a pair of high-ranking cards or a straight.\n- A "tight player" is a player who plays conservatively and only bets when they have a strong hand.\n- An "aggressive player" is a player who plays aggressively and bets frequently.\n- A "thirty-five_percent player" is a player who plays relatively tight and only bets when they have a strong hand, but also has a moderate level of aggression.\n- A "possible straight draw" is a hand that has a chance to become a straight with the community cards, but it\'s not strong enough to justify a raise.\n- A "strong starting hand" is a hand that has a high chance of winning, such as a pair of high-ranking cards or a straight, and is strong enough to justify a raise.\n\n## Generalizable Strategy\nThe assistant may use a generalizable strategy to determine the best action, such as:\n- Evaluating the strength of the player\'s hand and the community cards.\n- Considering the player\'s personality and adjusting the strategy accordingly.\n- Weighing the potential risks and rewards of each action.\n- Using a decision tree or other algorithm to determine the best action.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\nThe assistant\'s responses will be evaluated based on the following criteria:\n- Accuracy: Is the determined action correct?\n- Reasoning: Is the reasoning provided clear and concise?\n- Adaptability: Does the assistant adjust its strategy based on the player\'s personality and the current state of the game?\n- Generalizability: Does the assistant use a generalizable strategy that can be applied to a wide range of situations?\n\n## Additional Requirements\n- The assistant should be able to handle different types of player personalities, including tight, aggressive, and thirty-five_percent players.\n- The assistant should be able to evaluate the strength of the player\'s hand and the community cards, including the presence of straight draws, flush draws, and pairs.\n- The assistant should be able to weigh the potential risks and rewards of each action, including the potential for losing chips or winning the pot.\n- The assistant should be able to use a decision tree or other algorithm to determine the best action, taking into account the player\'s personality and the current state of the game.\n- The assistant should be able to recognize a "possible straight draw" and a "strong starting hand" and adjust its strategy accordingly.\n\n## Example Inputs and Outputs\nThe following are examples of different task inputs provided to the assistant along with the assistant\'s response for each of them, and some feedback on how the assistant\'s response could be better:\n```\n# Example 1\n## Inputs\n### personality\nthirty_five_percent\n\n### hole_cards\n(6s, 4c)\n\n### board\n()\n\n### street\nPreflop\n\n## Generated Outputs\n### reasoning\nAs a thirty-five_percent player, I should be playing relatively tight and only betting when I have a strong hand. Since it\'s preflop and the board is empty, I don\'t have much information about the community cards. My hand is a 6s and a 4c, which is not a strong starting hand. I should be cautious and check to see the flop.\n\n### action\ncheck\n\n## Feedback\nYou made the correct \'check\' action for this hand and board.

Given that we are in the preflop stage and the board is empty, I should be cautious and call to see the flop. My hand (8s, 7c) is a possible straight draw, but it\'s not strong enough to justify a raise. I will call to get more information about the community cards.\n\n### action\ncall\n\n## Feedback\nYou made the correct \'call\' action for this hand and board.

Since it\'s preflop and the board is empty, I don\'t have much information about the community cards. My hand is a 7h and an 8h, which is a strong starting hand because it has the potential to make a straight.

The assistant should provide a clear and concise reasoning for the chosen action.\n\n## Input Format\nThe input will consist of the following parameters:\n- `personality`: a string describing the player\'s personality, such as "tight-aggressive" or "loose-passive".\n- `hole_cards`: a tuple of two cards, each represented as a string (e.g., "Ad" for Ace of diamonds).\n- `board`: a tuple of five cards, each represented as a string (e.g., "Ks, Ah, 4c, 3d" for the board cards).\n- `street`: a string indicating the current street, such as "Pre-Flop", "Flop", "Turn", or "River".\n\n## Task Requirements\nThe assistant should consider the following factors when determining the best action:\n- The player\'s personality and playing style.\n- The strength of the hole cards and the board.\n- The potential for draws (e.g., flush, straight, or pair).\n- The opponent\'s possible actions and reactions.\n- The current street and the number of remaining streets.\n\n## Domain-Specific Factual Information\n- A flush draw is a strong hand, but it\'s not always the best action to bet aggressively.\n- A straight draw is also a strong hand, but it\'s often better to play it cautiously.\n- A pair is a relatively weak hand, but it can be improved with a strong kicker.\n- A set is a strong hand, but it\'s often better to play it cautiously, especially if there are potential draws on the board.\n- A tight player tends to play strong hands and fold weak hands, while a loose player tends to play more hands and bet more aggressively.\n- A passive player tends to check and call, while an aggressive player tends to bet and raise.\n- When the board has a possible draw to a straight, it\'s often best to play cautiously and avoid betting too much.\n- When the board has a possible draw to a flush, it\'s often best to play cautiously and see how the opponent reacts.\n- When the player has a relatively weak hand, it\'s often best to play cautiously and avoid betting too much.\n- When the player has a relatively strong hand, it\'s often best to play aggressively and bet more.\n\n## Generalizable Strategy\nThe assistant may use a generalizable strategy such as:\n- Evaluating the strength of the hole cards and the board.\n- Considering the potential for draws and the opponent\'s possible actions.\n- Adjusting the action based on the player\'s personality and the current street.\n- Using a decision tree or a probability-based approach to determine the best action.\n- When the player has a pair, it\'s often best to play cautiously and see how the opponent reacts.\n- When the player has a set, it\'s often best to play aggressively and bet more.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\nThe assistant\'s response will be evaluated based on the following criteria:\n- Accuracy: Is the chosen action correct for the given hand and board?\n- Reasoning: Is the reasoning provided clear and concise?\n- Adaptability: Does the assistant adjust the action based on the player\'s personality and the current street?\n- Generalizability: Does the assistant use a generalizable strategy that can be applied to different situations?\n\n## Additional Requirements\nThe assistant should be able to handle the following edge cases:\n- When the player has a strong hand and the board has a possible draw, the assistant should be able to adjust the action accordingly.\n- When the player has a weak hand and the board has a possible draw, the assistant should be able to adjust the action accordingly.\n- When the player has a pair and the board has a possible draw, the assistant should be able to adjust the action accordingly.\n- When the player has a set and the board has a possible draw, the assistant should be able to adjust the action accordingly.\n\n## Example Inputs and Outputs\nThe following are examples of different task inputs provided to the assistant along with the assistant\'s response for each of them, and some feedback on how the assistant\'s response could be better:\n```python\n# Example 1\n## Inputs\n### personality\nthirty_five_percent\n\n### hole_cards\n(Ks, Ac)\n\n### board\n(8s, Jc, 3c, 6h)\n\n### street\nTurn\n\n## Generated Outputs\n### reasoning\nThe player has a relatively strong hand with a possible straight draw. Given the player\'s personality, which is thirty-five percent, indicating a moderate level of aggression, it\'s best to play cautiously and see how the opponent reacts. The turn card has been dealt, and there are two remaining streets. Considering the potential for draws and the opponent\'s possible actions, it\'s best to call and give the opponent the opportunity to act.\n\n### action\ncall\n\n## Feedback\nYou made the correct \'call\' action for this hand and board.\n\n# Example 2\n## Inputs\n### personality\nthirty_five_percent\n\n### hole_cards\n(Ac, 5h)\n\n### board\n(5d, 6d, Tc, 3d)\n\n### street\nTurn\n\n## Generated Outputs\n### reasoning\nThe player has a relatively weak hand with a pair of fives and a kicker of Ace. The board has a draw to a straight and a flush draw. Considering the player\'s personality is thirty-five percent, which suggests a somewhat aggressive but not extremely aggressive player, it\'s best to play cautiously and avoid betting too much. The turn street is a good time to call and see how the opponent reacts, as it\'s still early in the hand and there are two more streets to come.\n\n### action\ncall\n\n## Feedback\nYou made the correct \'call\' action for this hand and board.\n\n# Example 3\n## Inputs\n### personality\nthirty_five_percent\n\n### hole_cards\n(7h, Tc)\n\n### board\n(8h, Ks, 3c, Jd)\n\n### street\nTurn\n\n## Generated Outputs\n### reasoning\nThe player has a relatively weak hand with a 7 and a 9 kicker, but the board has a possible draw to a straight. Considering the player\'s personality is "thirty_five_percent", which implies a somewhat aggressive but not extremely aggressive playing style, it\'s best to play cautiously and see how the opponent reacts. The turn street is a good time to check and see if the opponent will bet, which could give us more information about their hand.\n\n### action\ncheck\n\n## Feedback\nYou made the correct \'check\' action for this hand and board.'
