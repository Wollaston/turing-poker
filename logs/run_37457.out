The recommended action should be one of the following:\n- "call"\n- "raise"\n- "fold"\n\n## Domain-Specific Factual Information\n- A "fifty_percent" personality is a tight-aggressive player who likes to play strong hands.\n- A "fifty_percent" player tends to fold often.\n- A "fifty_percent" player is risk-averse.\n- A "fifty_percent" player likes to build the pot and see how their opponent reacts.\n- A "fifty_percent" player has a weak hand with no clear path to a strong win.\n- A "fifty_percent" player has a possible flush draw and a straight draw.\n- A "fifty_percent" player has a pair of sevens with a possible straight draw.\n- A "fifty_percent" player wants to build the pot and see how their opponent reacts.\n- A "fifty_percent" player is aggressive but also willing to fold if they don\'t have a strong hand.\n\n## Generalizable Strategy\nThe assistant should use a generalizable strategy to determine the best action, considering the following factors:\n- The player\'s personality\n- The current state of the board\n- The player\'s hole cards\n- The current street of the game\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\nThe assistant\'s response will be evaluated based on the following criteria:\n- Correctness: Is the recommended action correct for the given input?\n- Clarity: Is the reasoning clear and concise?\n- Relevance: Does the reasoning take into account the player\'s personality and the current state of the game?\n\n## Example Inputs and Feedback\nThe following are examples of different task inputs provided to the assistant along with the assistant\'s response for each of them, and some feedback on how the assistant\'s response could be better:\n\n# Example 1\n## Inputs\n### personality\nfifty_percent\n\n### hole_cards\n(Qh, 2s)\n\n### board\n(7h, 3h, 8h, 3s, 6c)\n\n### street\nRiver\n\n## Generated Outputs\n### reasoning\nWith a fifty_percent personality, I\'m a tight-aggressive player who likes to play strong hands. On the River, I have a Queen-high with a weak kicker, but the board has a possible flush draw and a straight draw. I need to be cautious and consider the possible hands my opponents might have.\n\n### action\ncall\n\n## Feedback\nYou made the correct \'call\' action for this hand and board. This correct action is indeed \'call\'.\n\n# Example 2\n## Inputs\n### personality\nfifty_percent\n\n### hole_cards\n(2c, 2s)\n\n### board\n(7h, Ah, Jh, 6c)\n\n### street\nTurn\n\n## Generated Outputs\n### reasoning\nI\'m a fifty_percent player, which means I\'m risk-averse and tend to fold often. Given my hole cards (2c, 2s) and the board (7h, Ah, Jh, 6c), I have a weak hand with no clear path to a strong win. The turn card hasn\'t improved my hand, and I\'m facing a possible draw or a stronger hand from my opponent.\n\n### action\nfold\n\n## Feedback\nYou made the incorrect \'fold\' action for this hand and board. The correct action is \'call\'. Think about how you could have reasoned to make the correct decision with you hand and the board cards.\n\n# Example 3\n## Inputs\n### personality\nfifty_percent\n\n### hole_cards\n(7s, Ts)\n\n### board\n(Td, 8c, 7d)\n\n### street\nFlop\n\n## Generated Outputs\n### reasoning\nI\'m a fifty_percent player, which means I\'m aggressive but also willing to fold if I don\'t have a strong hand. On the flop, I have a pair of sevens with a possible straight draw. The board has a ten and an eight, which doesn\'t improve my hand but also doesn\'t make it worse. Given my aggressive nature, I want to build the pot and see how my opponent reacts.\n\n### action\nraise\n\n## Feedback\nYou made the incorrect \'call\' action for this hand and board. The correct action is \'raise\'. Think about how you could have reasoned to make the correct decision with you hand and the board cards.'

The recommended action should be one of the following:\n- "call"\n- "raise"\n- "fold"\n\n## Domain-Specific Factual Information\n- A "fifty_percent" personality is a tight-aggressive player who likes to play strong hands.\n- A "fifty_percent" player tends to fold often.\n- A "fifty_percent" player is risk-averse.\n- A "fifty_percent" player likes to build the pot and see how their opponent reacts.\n- A "fifty_percent" player has a weak hand with no clear path to a strong win.\n- A "fifty_percent" player has a possible flush draw and a straight draw.\n- A "fifty_percent" player has a pair of sevens with a possible straight draw.\n- A "fifty_percent" player wants to build the pot and see how their opponent reacts.\n- A "fifty_percent" player is aggressive but also willing to fold if they don\'t have a strong hand.\n\n## Generalizable Strategy\nThe assistant should use a generalizable strategy to determine the best action, considering the following factors:\n- The player\'s personality\n- The current state of the board\n- The player\'s hole cards\n- The current street of the game\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\nThe assistant\'s response will be evaluated based on the following criteria:\n- Correctness: Is the recommended action correct for the given input?\n- Clarity: Is the reasoning clear and concise?\n- Relevance: Does the reasoning take into account the player\'s personality and the current state of the game?\n\n## Example Inputs and Feedback\nThe following are examples of different task inputs provided to the assistant along with the assistant\'s response for each of them, and some feedback on how the assistant\'s response could be better:\n\n# Example 1\n## Inputs\n### personality\nfifty_percent\n\n### hole_cards\n(Qh, 2s)\n\n### board\n(7h, 3h, 8h, 3s, 6c)\n\n### street\nRiver\n\n## Generated Outputs\n### reasoning\nWith a fifty_percent personality, I\'m a tight-aggressive player who likes to play strong hands. On the River, I have a Queen-high with a weak kicker, but the board has a possible flush draw and a straight draw. I need to be cautious and consider the possible hands my opponents might have.\n\n### action\ncall\n\n## Feedback\nYou made the correct \'call\' action for this hand and board. This correct action is indeed \'call\'.\n\n# Example 2\n## Inputs\n### personality\nfifty_percent\n\n### hole_cards\n(2c, 2s)\n\n### board\n(7h, Ah, Jh, 6c)\n\n### street\nTurn\n\n## Generated Outputs\n### reasoning\nI\'m a fifty_percent player, which means I\'m risk-averse and tend to fold often. Given my hole cards (2c, 2s) and the board (7h, Ah, Jh, 6c), I have a weak hand with no clear path to a strong win. The turn card hasn\'t improved my hand, and I\'m facing a possible draw or a stronger hand from my opponent.\n\n### action\nfold\n\n## Feedback\nYou made the incorrect \'fold\' action for this hand and board. The correct action is \'call\'. Think about how you could have reasoned to make the correct decision with you hand and the board cards.\n\n# Example 3\n## Inputs\n### personality\nfifty_percent\n\n### hole_cards\n(7s, Ts)\n\n### board\n(Td, 8c, 7d)\n\n### street\nFlop\n\n## Generated Outputs\n### reasoning\nI\'m a fifty_percent player, which means I\'m aggressive but also willing to fold if I don\'t have a strong hand. On the flop, I have a pair of sevens with a possible straight draw. The board has a ten and an eight, which doesn\'t improve my hand but also doesn\'t make it worse. Given my aggressive nature, I want to build the pot and see how my opponent reacts.\n\n### action\nraise\n\n## Feedback\nYou made the incorrect \'call\' action for this hand and board.

On the river, I have a weak hand with a possible draw on the board (two 2s with a 6d on the board).

The inputs will include the player\'s personality, their hole cards, the current state of the board, and the current street. The assistant should provide a reasoning for their decision and the recommended action.\n\n## Input Format\nThe inputs will be in the following format:\n- `personality`: A string describing the player\'s personality (e.g., "fifty_percent", "tight-aggressive", etc.)\n- `hole_cards`: A tuple of two cards representing the player\'s hole cards (e.g., "(7s, Ks)")\n- `board`: A tuple of cards representing the current state of the board (e.g., "()")\n- `street`: A string describing the current street (e.g., "Preflop", "Flop", "Turn", "River")\n\n## Task Requirements\nThe assistant should consider the following factors when determining the best action:\n- The player\'s personality and how it affects their playing style\n- The strength of the player\'s hole cards and how they relate to the board\n- The current state of the board and how it affects the player\'s hand\n- The current street and how it affects the player\'s decision-making process\n\n## Domain-Specific Factual Information\n- A "fifty_percent" player is an aggressive player who likes to play a lot of hands.\n- A "tight-aggressive" player is a player who plays strong hands aggressively.\n- The strength of a hand is determined by the ranking of the cards and the kicker (the highest card in a hand).\n- In preflop, players should consider the strength of their hand and the number of players in the hand when deciding whether to call, raise, or fold.\n- In later streets, players should consider the board texture, the number of players in the hand, and the strength of their hand when deciding whether to check, bet, or fold.\n\n## Generalizable Strategy\nThe assistant should use a decision-making framework that considers the player\'s personality, the strength of their hand, and the current state of the board. The assistant should also consider the potential outcomes of each action and choose the action that maximizes the player\'s expected value.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\nThe assistant\'s responses will be evaluated based on the accuracy of their reasoning and the correctness of their recommended action. The assistant\'s responses should be clear and concise, and they should provide a clear explanation for their decision.\n\n## Example Inputs and Feedback\nThe following are examples of inputs and feedback:\n```\n# Example 1\n## Inputs\n### personality\nfifty_percent\n\n### hole_cards\n(7s, Ks)\n\n### board\n()\n\n### street\nPreflop\n\n## Generated Outputs\n### reasoning\nI\'m a fifty_percent player, which means I\'m very aggressive and like to play a lot of hands. Since it\'s preflop and the board is empty, I\'ll play my hand aggressively. I have a strong hand with a high kicker (Ks), so I\'ll raise to build the pot.\n\n### action\nraise\n\n## Feedback\nYou made the incorrect \'raise\' action for this hand and board. The correct action is \'call\'. Think about how you could have reasoned to make the correct decision with you hand and the board cards.\n\n# Example 2\n## Inputs\n### personality\nfifty_percent\n\n### hole_cards\n(9h, Jh)\n\n### board\n()\n\n### street\nPreflop\n\n## Generated Outputs\n### reasoning\nI\'m a fifty_percent player, which means I like to play tight-aggressive. Since it\'s preflop and I have a relatively strong hand with a 9h and a Jh, I should consider raising to build the pot and narrow the field.\n\n### action\nraise\n\n## Feedback\nYou made the correct \'raise\' action for this hand and board. This correct action is indeed \'raise\'.\n\n# Example 3\n## Inputs\n### personality\nfifty_percent\n\n### hole_cards\n(4h, Ad)\n\n### board\n()\n\n### street\nPreflop\n\n## Generated Outputs\n### reasoning\nI\'m a fifty_percent player, which means I\'m likely to be aggressive and play a lot of hands. Since it\'s preflop and the board is empty, I should be looking to play my strong hands and build the pot. With a hand of (4h, Ad), I have a strong ace and a relatively weak kicker. I should be looking to play this hand aggressively to maximize my expected value.\n\n### action\nraise\n\n## Feedback\nYou made the incorrect \'raise\' action for this hand and board.

The assistant should analyze the input and provide a clear and concise reasoning for the best action to take.\n\n## Input Format\nThe input will be in the following format:\n- `personality`: A string describing the player's personality (e.g., 'fifty_percent', 'tight', 'loose', etc.)\n- `hole_cards`: A tuple of two strings representing the player's hole cards (e.g., ('6h', '5d'))\n- `board`: A tuple of five strings representing the board cards (e.g., ('4h', 'Kh', '6d', 'Jh', '6c'))\n- `street`: A string representing the current street (e.g., 'River', 'Flop', 'Turn')\n\n## Task Requirements\nThe assistant should consider the following:\n- A set of sixes is a decent hand in Poker.\n- A king on the board can be a strong hand for someone else.\n- On the river, it's generally a good idea to be cautious and not overplay a hand.\n- A broadway draw with a possible flush draw on the board can be a strong hand.\n- A weak hand with a possible draw on the board can be a good reason to check.\n- A tight player likes to minimize losses and avoid risk.\n- A loose player likes to maximize their expected value and take risks.\n- The assistant should adapt to different player personalities and hand strengths.\n- The assistant should consider the potential strength of the opponent's hand.\n\n## Generalizable Strategy\nThe assistant should consider the following generalizable strategy:\n- Analyze the player's personality and adjust the strategy accordingly.\n- Evaluate the strength of the player's hand and the board cards.\n- Consider the potential strength of the opponent's hand.\n- Make a decision based on the player's personality, hand strength, and potential opponent strength.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\nThe assistant's response will be evaluated based on the following criteria:\n- Correctness: Is the action taken correct based on the input and the generalizable strategy?\n- Reasoning: Is the reasoning provided clear and concise?\n- Adaptability: Does the assistant adapt to different player personalities and hand strengths?\n\n## Additional Requirements\n- The assistant should consider the following specific scenarios:\n  - When the player has a weak hand with a possible draw on the board, the assistant should recommend checking.\n  - When the player has a strong hand, the assistant should recommend raising or all-in.\n  - When the player is a tight player, the assistant should recommend minimizing losses and avoiding risk.\n  - When the player is a loose player, the assistant should recommend maximizing their expected value and taking risks.\n  - When the player is on the river, the assistant should be cautious and not overplay their hand.\n\n## Example Inputs and Outputs\nThe following are examples of different task inputs provided to the assistant along with the assistant's response for each of them:\n```\n# Example 1\n## Inputs\n### personality\nfifty_percent\n\n### hole_cards\n(3d, Ts)\n\n### board\n(9h, 2c, 9s, 2s, Th)\n\n### street\nRiver\n\n## Generated Outputs\n### reasoning\nAs a fifty_percent player, I'm looking to minimize losses and avoid risk. Given the board cards (9h, 2c, 9s, 2s, Th) and my hole cards (3d, Ts), I don't have a strong hand. The board doesn't seem to have any pairs or runs that would improve my hand. Considering the river is the final street, I should be cautious and not overplay my hand. Since I don't have a strong hand, I'll choose to call to minimize my losses.\n\n### action\ncall\n\n## Example 2\n## Inputs\n### personality\nloose\n\n### hole_cards\n(2c, 2d)\n\n### board\n(Ad, 8d, 6d, 7c, 3c)\n\n### street\nRiver\n\n## Generated Outputs\n### reasoning\nAs a loose player, I'm looking to maximize my expected value and take risks. On the river, I have a weak hand with a possible draw on the board (two 2s with a 6d on the board). Considering the board cards, there's a possible flush draw, and I'll take a chance to raise and try to maximize my expected value.\n\n### action\nraise\n\n## Example 3\n## Inputs\n### personality\ntight\n\n### hole_cards\n(2c, Jd)\n\n### board\n(6h, Qh, 9s, 4s, As)\n\n### street\nRiver\n\n## Generated Outputs\n### reasoning\nAs a tight player, I'm looking to minimize losses and avoid risk. Given the board cards (6h, Qh, 9s, 4s, As) and my hole cards (2c, Jd), I don't have a strong hand. The presence of a possible set of sixes on the board makes it less likely for me to win.

    instructions='python\n# Task Instruction\n\n## Task Description\nThe task is to determine the best action for a given Poker Hand, considering the player\'s personality and the current state of the game.\n\n## Input Format\nThe input will consist of the following parameters:\n\n* `personality`: A string describing the player\'s personality, such as "fifty_percent", "aggressive", or "passive".\n* `hole_cards`: A tuple of two cards representing the player\'s hole cards, in the format (rank, suit).\n* `board`: A tuple of five cards representing the current state of the board, in the format (rank, suit).\n* `street`: A string indicating the current street of the game, such as "Pre-Flop", "Flop", "Turn", or "River".\n\n## Task Requirements\nThe assistant should use the following strategies to determine the best action:\n\n* Consider the player\'s personality and adjust the decision-making process accordingly.\n* Evaluate the strength of the player\'s hand and the potential for improvement based on the board cards.\n* Consider the potential actions of the opponent and the likelihood of them improving their hand.\n* Use a risk-averse approach for players with a "fifty_percent" personality, and a more aggressive approach for players with an "aggressive" personality.\n* Identify and evaluate the presence of straight draws, flush draws, and other strong hand possibilities.\n* Consider the importance of the turn and river streets in the game, as they can significantly improve or ruin a hand.\n\n## Domain-Specific Factual Information\n* In Poker, the goal is to make the best five-card hand possible using any combination of the player\'s hole cards and the board cards.\n* The strength of a hand is determined by the ranking of the cards, with higher-ranking cards being stronger.\n* A straight draw is a hand that has the potential to improve to a straight, which is a strong hand.\n* A flush draw is a hand that has the potential to improve to a flush, which is a strong hand.\n* The turn and river streets are critical points in the game, as they can significantly improve or ruin a hand.\n* A player with a "fifty_percent" personality is risk-averse and tends to play more conservatively, while a player with an "aggressive" personality is more likely to take risks and play more aggressively.\n\n## Generalizable Strategy\nThe assistant should use a decision tree or a similar algorithm to evaluate the player\'s hand and the board cards, and determine the best action based on the player\'s personality and the game state.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\nThe assistant\'s responses will be evaluated based on the correctness of the action and the quality of the reasoning provided.\n\n## Example Inputs and Feedback\nThe following examples demonstrate the input format and the expected output:\n\n* Example 1:\n        + Inputs: `personality="fifty_percent"`, `hole_cards=(9c, 6h)`, `board=(Qs, 6d, 7s, Th, 5h)`, `street="River"`\n        + Feedback: "You made the correct \'call\' action for this hand and board."\n* Example 2:\n        + Inputs: `personality="fifty_percent"`, `hole_cards=(5h, 8s)`, `board=(Kh, 7s, Jc, Ac)`, `street="Turn"`\n        + Feedback: "You made the incorrect \'fold\' action for this hand and board. The correct action is \'check\'."\n* Example 3:\n        + Inputs: `personality="fifty_percent"`, `hole_cards=(2s, 3h)`, `board=(7h, Kd, 3c, Th)`, `street="Turn"`\n        + Feedback: "You made the incorrect \'fold\' action for this hand and board. The correct action is \'call\'."\n\n## Task Goals\nThe primary goal of this task is to develop an assistant that can determine the best action for a given Poker Hand, considering the player\'s personality and the current state of the game. The secondary goal is to evaluate the assistant\'s responses based on the correctness of the action and the quality of the reasoning provided.\n\n## Additional Requirements\nThe assistant should be able to identify and evaluate the presence of straight draws, flush draws, and other strong hand possibilities. The assistant should also consider the importance of the turn and river streets in the game, as they can significantly improve or ruin a hand.\n\n## Niche and Domain-Specific Factual Information\n* In Poker, a player\'s hand can be improved by the board cards, and the strength of the hand is determined by the ranking of the cards.\n* A straight draw is a hand that has the potential to improve to a straight, which is a strong hand.\n* A flush draw is a hand that has the potential to improve to a flush, which is a strong hand.\n* The turn and river streets are critical points in the game, as they can significantly improve or ruin a hand.\n* A player with a "fifty_percent" personality is risk-averse and tends to play more conservatively, while a player with an "aggressive" personality is more likely to take risks and play more aggressively.\n\n## Generalizable Strategy\nThe assistant should use a decision tree or a similar algorithm to evaluate the player\'s hand and the board cards, and determine the best action based on the player\'s personality and the game state.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\nThe assistant\'s responses will be evaluated based on the correctness of the action and the quality of the reasoning provided.\n\n## Example Inputs and Feedback\nThe following examples demonstrate the input format and the expected output:\n\n* Example 1:\n        + Inputs: `personality="fifty_percent"`, `hole_cards=(8d, As)`, `board=(Td, 8c, Jh, Th)`, `street="Turn"`\n        + Feedback: "You made the correct \'call\' action for this hand and board."\n* Example 2:\n        + Inputs: `personality="fifty_percent"`, `hole_cards=(4c, 8c)`, `board=(9c, Qd, Jh, 4d)`, `street="Turn"`\n        + Feedback: "You made the incorrect \'fold\' action for this hand and board.
