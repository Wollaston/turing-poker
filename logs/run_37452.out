    instructions="python\n# Task Instruction\n\n## Task Description\nThe task is to determine the best action for a given poker hand, considering the player's personality, hole cards, board cards, and the current street.\n\n## Input Format\nThe input will be a dictionary with the following keys:\n- `personality`: a string describing the player's personality (e.g., 'nine_percent')\n- `hole_cards`: a tuple of two cards representing the player's hole cards (e.g., ('8c', 'Jc'))\n- `board`: a tuple of five cards representing the community board (e.g., ('Qc', '6d', 'Th', '4s'))\n- `street`: a string indicating the current street (e.g., 'Turn', 'Flop', 'River')\n\n## Task Requirements\nThe assistant should consider the following factors when determining the best action:\n- The player's personality and corresponding playing style (e.g., tight, aggressive)\n- The strength of the player's hole cards and their potential to improve with the community board\n- The community board's potential for flush draws, straight draws, or other strong hands\n- The current street and the potential for future streets to improve the player's hand\n- The opponent's betting pattern and potential aggression level\n\n## Domain-Specific Factual Information\n- A 'nine_percent' personality indicates a tight player who only plays strong hands.\n- A flush draw is a strong hand that has a high chance of improving to a flush.\n- A straight draw is a strong hand that has a high chance of improving to a straight.\n- Top pair is a strong hand that has a pair with the highest card on the board.\n- A weak top pair is a top pair with a relatively low card (e.g., 4s).\n\n## Generalizable Strategy\nThe assistant should use a decision tree or a similar strategy to evaluate the player's hand and the community board, considering the factors mentioned above. The assistant should also be able to identify and avoid common mistakes, such as calling with a weak hand or folding a strong hand.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\nThe assistant's response will be evaluated based on the correctness of the action and the quality of the reasoning. The assistant should provide a clear and concise explanation of the thought process behind the action, including the factors considered and the decision made.\n\n## Example Inputs and Feedback\nThe following examples demonstrate the input format and the expected output:\n```\n# Example 1\n## Inputs\n### personality\nnine_percent\n\n### hole_cards\n(8c, Jc)\n\n### board\n(Qc, 6d, Th, 4s)\n\n### street\nTurn\n\n## Generated Outputs\n### reasoning\nWith a turn street and a board of Qc, 6d, Th, 4s, I have a possible flush draw with my hole cards 8c and Jc. However, the board also has a possible straight draw and a weak top pair for a possible straight. Given my aggressive personality, I should consider raising to protect my hand and potentially build the pot.\n\n### action\nraise\n\n## Feedback\nYou made the incorrect 'call' action for this hand and board.

Given the flop of (Qc, 6d, 7h) and my hole cards (Jc, Qd), I have a pair of queens, which is a decent hand. However, the board also has a possible flush draw with the 6d and the Qc, so I'll need to be cautious.

The decision tree should take into account the following factors:\n- The player's personality and how it affects their betting and folding behavior.\n- The strength of the hand, including the presence of pairs, flush draws, and strong hands.\n- The current state of the game, including the street and the board cards.\n- The possibility of improving the hand with the next card.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\nThe assistant's responses will be evaluated based on their accuracy and the reasoning provided. The assistant should provide a clear and concise explanation of their decision, including the factors that led to their conclusion.\n\n## Example Inputs and Outputs\nThe following are examples of input and output for the task:\n```\n# Example 1\n## Inputs\n### personality\nnine_percent\n\n### hole_cards\n(6h, 9h)\n\n### board\n(Td, 5c, Kd, 9s, 6c)\n\n### street\nRiver\n\n## Generated Outputs\n### reasoning\nI'm a nine_percent player, so I'll be playing fairly tight. Given that the board has paired on the river and I have a pair of sixes and a pair of nines, I have a strong hand. However, the board also has a ten and a king, which could be part of a stronger hand. I'll need to consider the possibility that my opponent has a stronger hand and decide whether to bet or check.\n\n### action\ncall\n\n## Feedback\nYou made the correct 'call' action for this hand and board. This correct action is indeed 'call'.\n\n# Example 2\n## Inputs\n### personality\nnine_percent\n\n### hole_cards\n(Qc, Ah)\n\n### board\n(5s, 7h, 9s, 4h)\n\n### street\nTurn\n\n## Generated Outputs\n### reasoning\nI'm a nine_percent player, so I'll be playing fairly tight. With a strong Ace-high hand and a possible flush draw, I need to consider my opponent's possible actions. Since it's the Turn, my opponent may be trying to trap me or build a strong hand. However, my hand is still quite strong, and I have a good chance of winning if I can get a good price.\n\n### action\ncall\n\n## Feedback\nYou made the incorrect 'call' action for this hand and board. The correct action is 'fold'. Think about how you could have reasoned to make the correct decision with you hand and the board cards.\n\n# Example 3\n## Inputs\n### personality\nnine_percent\n\n### hole_cards\n(Qc, 3c)\n\n### board\n(Qs, 4d, Tc, Qd, 3s)\n\n### street\nRiver\n\n## Generated Outputs\n### reasoning\nI'm a nine_percent player, which means I'm a tight-aggressive player. Given that I have a pair of Queens (Qc, 3c) and the board is (Qs, 4d, Tc, Qd, 3s), I have a strong hand. The river has not improved my hand, so I should be cautious not to overplay my hand. However, since I have a strong hand and my opponent may have a weaker hand, I should aim to maximize my winnings.\n\n### action\ncall\n\n## Feedback\nYou made the incorrect 'call' action for this hand and board.

The inputs include the player's personality, hole cards, board cards, and the current street.\n\n## Input Format\nThe input format is as follows:\n- `personality`: A string representing the player's personality, such as 'nine_percent'.\n- `hole_cards`: A tuple of two strings representing the player's hole cards, e.g., `(5c, 4d)`.\n- `board`: A tuple of five strings representing the community board cards, e.g., `(Qc, 4c, Ad)`.\n- `street`: A string representing the current street, e.g., 'Flop', 'Turn', or 'River'.\n\n## Task Requirements\nThe assistant should analyze the inputs and determine the best action for the player based on their personality and the given hand. The action can be one of the following:\n- `check`\n- `bet`\n- `raise`\n- `call`\n- `fold`\n- `all_in`\n\n## Domain-Specific Factual Information\n- A 'nine_percent' player is a tight-aggressive player who plays fairly tight and only bets/raises with strong hands.\n- A flush draw is a possible hand when a player has four cards of the same suit and the fifth card on the board is also of the same suit.\n- A straight draw is a possible hand when a player has five cards in sequential order, but one card is missing.\n- A pair is a hand when a player has two cards of the same rank.\n- A set is a hand when a player has three cards of the same rank.\n- A King kicker is a hand when a player has a pair and a King as the highest card.\n\n## Generalizable Strategy\nThe assistant should use a decision tree or a similar strategy to determine the best action based on the player's personality and the given hand. The strategy should consider the following factors:\n- The player's personality and their corresponding playing style.\n- The strength of the player's hand, including the presence of a pair, set, or straight draw.\n- The presence of possible draws, such as a flush draw or a straight draw.\n- The current street and the number of community cards remaining.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\nThe assistant's response will be evaluated based on the correctness of the action and the quality of the reasoning provided. The feedback will include suggestions for improvement and additional information to consider.\n\n## Example Inputs and Feedback\nThe following are examples of different task inputs provided to the assistant along with the assistant's response for each of them, and some feedback on how the assistant's response could be better:\n```\n# Example 1\n## Inputs\n### personality\nnine_percent\n\n### hole_cards\n(5c, 4d)\n\n### board\n(Qc, 4c, Ad)\n\n### street\nFlop\n\n## Generated Outputs\n### reasoning\nI'm a nine_percent player, so I'll be playing fairly tight. On the flop, I have a possible flush draw with my 4d and the 4c on the board. However, the Ad on the board also gives me a possible straight draw. Given my tight image, I don't want to get too aggressive, but I also don't want to give up my potential hand.\n\n### action\ncall\n\n## Feedback\nYou made the incorrect 'call' action for this hand and board. The correct action is 'fold'. Think about how you could have reasoned to make the correct decision with you hand and the board cards.\n\n\n\n# Example 2\n## Inputs\n### personality\nnine_percent\n\n### hole_cards\n(7h, 9s)\n\n### board\n(7d, 5s, 6d, 7c, 5h)\n\n### street\nRiver\n\n## Generated Outputs\n### reasoning\nI'm a nine_percent player, which means I'm a tight-aggressive player. I have a relatively strong hand with a pair of sevens (7h, 9s) and the board has a set of sevens (7d, 5s, 6d, 7c, 5h). However, the board also has two fives, which could be a possible draw for my opponent. Considering my aggressive nature, I want to maximize my potential winnings, but I also need to be cautious of the possible draw.\n\n### action\ncall\n\n## Feedback\nYou made the incorrect 'call' action for this hand and board. The correct action is 'all_in'. Think about how you could have reasoned to make the correct decision with you hand and the board cards.\n\n\n\n# Example 3\n## Inputs\n### personality\nnine_percent\n\n### hole_cards\n(7s, Qc)\n\n### board\n(4h, Kh, Qd, 2s, 2d)\n\n### street\nRiver\n\n## Generated Outputs\n### reasoning\nI'm a nine_percent player, so I'll be playing fairly tight. On the River, I have a pair of Queens with a King kicker, which is a decent hand. However, the board has a possible flush draw and a possible straight draw, so I need to be cautious. I'll consider the possible hands my opponent could have and decide on my action accordingly.\n\n### action\ncall\n\n## Feedback\nYou made the incorrect 'call' action for this hand and board.

The board has a possible flush draw with the Ah and the 2h, but my hole cards don't have any flush potential. I also don't have a strong straight draw. Considering the possible hands my opponent could have, I'll need to be cautious.\n\n### action\nfold\n\n## Feedback\nYou made the correct 'fold' action for this hand and board. This correct action is indeed 'fold'.\n\n# Example 2\n## Inputs\n### personality\nnine_percent\n\n### hole_cards\n(Ah, 9c)\n\n### board\n(Td, 8d, 6d, 4s, 2s)\n\n### street\nRiver\n\n## Generated Outputs\n### reasoning\nI'm a nine_percent player, which means I'm a tight-aggressive player. Given that the board is relatively weak (no pairs, no strong draws) and I have a 9c, I'm not getting any strong hands. However, I do have a possible flush draw with the 9c and the 8d, 6d, and 2s on the board. Since it's the River, I should consider calling to see if I can make a flush.\n\n### action\ncall\n\n## Feedback\nYou made the incorrect 'check' action for this hand and board. The correct action is 'fold'. Think about how you could have reasoned to make the correct decision with you hand and the board cards.\n\n# Example 3\n## Inputs\n### personality\nnine_percent\n\n### hole_cards\n(Ts, 3h)\n\n### board\n(8h, Qd, 6s, Js)\n\n### street\nTurn\n\n## Generated Outputs\n### reasoning\nWith a turn street and a board of (8h, Qd, 6s, Js), I have a possible flush draw with my hole cards (Ts, 3h). However, the board also contains a jack, which could be a strong hand for someone else. Given my aggressive personality, I should consider raising to protect my hand and potentially build the pot.\n\n### action\nraise\n\n## Feedback\nYou made the incorrect 'raise' action for this hand and board. The correct action is 'fold'. Think about how you could have reasoned to make the correct decision with you hand and the board cards."

The assistant should provide a clear and concise explanation for the action taken.\n\n## Example Inputs and Feedback\nThe following are examples of different task inputs provided to the assistant along with the assistant's response for each of them, and some feedback on how the assistant's response could be better:\n```\n# Example 1\n## Inputs\n### personality\nnine_percent\n\n### hole_cards\n(4h, 8d)\n\n### board\n(Ad, 7d, 2s)\n\n### street\nFlop\n\n## Generated Outputs\n### reasoning\nI'm a nine_percent player, so I'll be playing fairly tight. The flop has come out with a possible draw for a straight and a possible flush draw. My hole cards are a low pair, but I have a possible draw to a straight. I'll need to be careful not to get too aggressive and give away my hand.\n\n### action\ncall\n\n## Feedback\nYou made the incorrect 'call' action for this hand and board. The correct action is 'fold'. Think about how you could have reasoned to make the correct decision with you hand and the board cards.\n\n\n\n# Example 2\n## Inputs\n### personality\nnine_percent\n\n### hole_cards\n(Ks, Qc)\n\n### board\n(Qh, Qd, Ah)\n\n### street\nFlop\n\n## Generated Outputs\n### reasoning\nI'm a nine-percenter, so I like to play aggressively. I have a strong hand with a possible straight draw and a possible flush draw. The flop has improved my hand significantly, and I need to take advantage of this. I'll raise to put pressure on my opponent and potentially build the pot.\n\n### action\nraise\n\n## Feedback\nYou made the incorrect 'raise' action for this hand and board. The correct action is 'call'. Think about how you could have reasoned to make the correct decision with you hand and the board cards.\n\n\n\n# Example 3\n## Inputs\n### personality\nnine_percent\n\n### hole_cards\n(2c, Jc)\n\n### board\n(Qd, Qs, 5c)\n\n### street\nFlop\n\n## Generated Outputs\n### reasoning\nI'm a nine_percent player, so I'm looking to play tight-aggressive. On the flop, I have a possible flush draw with my Jc and 2c, but the board also has a possible straight draw. Given the strength of the board, I'll need to be cautious and consider the range of my opponent.\n\n### action\ncall\n\n## Feedback\nYou made the incorrect 'call' action for this hand and board. The correct action is 'fold'. Think about how you could have reasoned to make the correct decision with you hand and the board cards."

The reasoning should include an analysis of the possible hands the player could have and the potential actions of the opponent.\n\n## Domain-Specific Factual Information\n- A 'nine_percent' player is a tight-aggressive player who plays fairly tight and aggressively.\n- A flush draw is a possible hand when a player has a card of the same suit as four or more cards on the board.\n- A straight draw is a possible hand when a player has a sequence of cards (e.g., 3-4-5) and there are two or more cards on the board that could complete the sequence.\n- A player should be cautious when facing a possible flush draw or straight draw from an opponent.\n- A player should consider raising to protect their hand and build the pot when facing a possible flush draw or straight draw from an opponent.\n\n## Generalizable Strategy\nThe assistant should use a decision tree or a similar strategy to determine the best action based on the input parameters.

The board has a possible flush draw with the Ah and the 2h, but my hole cards don't have any flush potential. I also don't have a strong straight draw. Considering the possible hands my opponent could have, I'll need to be cautious.\n\n### action\nfold\n\n## Feedback\nYou made the correct 'fold' action for this hand and board.

Given that the board is relatively weak (no pairs, no strong draws) and I have a 9c, I'm not getting any strong hands. However, I do have a possible flush draw with the 9c and the 8d, 6d, and 2s on the board. Since it's the River, I should consider calling to see if I can make a flush.\n\n### action\ncall\n\n## Feedback\nYou made the incorrect 'check' action for this hand and board. The correct action is 'fold'. Think about how you could have reasoned to make the correct decision with you hand and the board cards.\n\n# Example 3\n## Inputs\n### personality\nnine_percent\n\n### hole_cards\n(Ts, 3h)\n\n### board\n(8h, Qd, 6s, Js)\n\n### street\nTurn\n\n## Generated Outputs\n### reasoning\nWith a turn street and a board of (8h, Qd, 6s, Js), I have a possible flush draw with my hole cards (Ts, 3h). However, the board also contains a jack, which could be a strong hand for someone else. Given my aggressive personality, I should consider raising to protect my hand and potentially build the pot.\n\n### action\nraise\n\n## Feedback\nYou made the incorrect 'raise' action for this hand and board.

The decision tree should take into account the following factors:\n- The player's personality and how it affects their betting and folding behavior.\n- The strength of the hand, including the presence of pairs, flush draws, and strong hands.\n- The current state of the game, including the street and the board cards.\n- The possibility of improving the hand with the next card.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\nThe assistant's responses will be evaluated based on their accuracy and the reasoning provided.

The inputs include the player's personality, hole cards, board cards, and the current street.\n\n## Input Format\nThe input format is as follows:\n- `personality`: A string representing the player's personality, such as 'nine_percent'.\n- `hole_cards`: A tuple of two strings representing the player's hole cards, e.g., `(5c, 4d)`.\n- `board`: A tuple of five strings representing the community board cards, e.g., `(Qc, 4c, Ad)`.\n- `street`: A string representing the current street, e.g., 'Flop', 'Turn', or 'River'.\n\n## Task Requirements\nThe assistant should analyze the inputs and determine the best action for the player based on their personality and the given hand. The action can be one of the following:\n- `check`\n- `bet`\n- `raise`\n- `call`\n- `fold`\n- `all_in`\n\n## Domain-Specific Factual Information\n- A 'nine_percent' player is a tight-aggressive player who plays fairly tight and only bets/raises with strong hands.\n- A flush draw is a possible hand when a player has four cards of the same suit and the fifth card on the board is also of the same suit.\n- A straight draw is a possible hand when a player has five cards in sequential order, but one card is missing.\n- A pair is a hand when a player has two cards of the same rank.\n- A set is a hand when a player has three cards of the same rank.\n- A King kicker is a hand when a player has a pair and a King as the highest card.\n\n## Generalizable Strategy\nThe assistant should use a decision tree or a similar strategy to determine the best action based on the player's personality and the given hand. The strategy should consider the following factors:\n- The player's personality and their corresponding playing style.\n- The strength of the player's hand, including the presence of a pair, set, or straight draw.\n- The presence of possible draws, such as a flush draw or a straight draw.\n- The current street and the number of community cards remaining.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\nThe assistant's response will be evaluated based on the correctness of the action and the quality of the reasoning provided.

On the flop, I have a possible flush draw with my 4d and the 4c on the board. However, the Ad on the board also gives me a possible straight draw. Given my tight image, I don't want to get too aggressive, but I also don't want to give up my potential hand.\n\n### action\ncall\n\n## Feedback\nYou made the incorrect 'call' action for this hand and board. The correct action is 'fold'.

I have a relatively strong hand with a pair of sevens (7h, 9s) and the board has a set of sevens (7d, 5s, 6d, 7c, 5h). However, the board also has two fives, which could be a possible draw for my opponent. Considering my aggressive nature, I want to maximize my potential winnings, but I also need to be cautious of the possible draw.\n\n### action\ncall\n\n## Feedback\nYou made the incorrect 'call' action for this hand and board. The correct action is 'all_in'.

The decision tree should take into account the following factors:\n- The player's personality and how it affects their betting and folding behavior.\n- The strength of the hand, including the presence of pairs, flush draws, and strong hands.\n- The current state of the game, including the street and the board cards.\n- The possibility of improving the hand with the next card.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\nThe assistant's responses will be evaluated based on their accuracy and the reasoning provided.

Given that the board has paired on the river and I have a pair of sixes and a pair of nines, I have a strong hand. However, the board also has a ten and a king, which could be part of a stronger hand. I'll need to consider the possibility that my opponent has a stronger hand and decide whether to bet or check.\n\n### action\ncall\n\n## Feedback\nYou made the correct 'call' action for this hand and board.

With a strong Ace-high hand and a possible flush draw, I need to consider my opponent's possible actions. Since it's the Turn, my opponent may be trying to trap me or build a strong hand. However, my hand is still quite strong, and I have a good chance of winning if I can get a good price.\n\n### action\ncall\n\n## Feedback\nYou made the incorrect 'call' action for this hand and board.

    instructions="python\n# Task Instruction\n\n## Task Description\nThe task is to determine the best action for a given poker hand, considering the player's personality, hole cards, board cards, and the current street.\n\n## Input Format\nThe input will be a dictionary with the following keys:\n- `personality`: a string describing the player's personality (e.g., 'nine_percent')\n- `hole_cards`: a tuple of two cards representing the player's hole cards (e.g., ('8c', 'Jc'))\n- `board`: a tuple of five cards representing the community board (e.g., ('Qc', '6d', 'Th', '4s'))\n- `street`: a string indicating the current street (e.g., 'Turn', 'Flop', 'River')\n\n## Task Requirements\nThe assistant should consider the following factors when determining the best action:\n- The player's personality and corresponding playing style (e.g., tight, aggressive)\n- The strength of the player's hole cards and their potential to improve with the community board\n- The community board's potential for flush draws, straight draws, or other strong hands\n- The current street and the potential for future streets to improve the player's hand\n- The opponent's betting pattern and potential aggression level\n\n## Domain-Specific Factual Information\n- A 'nine_percent' personality indicates a tight player who only plays strong hands.\n- A flush draw is a strong hand that has a high chance of improving to a flush.\n- A straight draw is a strong hand that has a high chance of improving to a straight.\n- Top pair is a strong hand that has a pair with the highest card on the board.\n- A weak top pair is a top pair with a relatively low card (e.g., 4s).\n\n## Generalizable Strategy\nThe assistant should use a decision tree or a similar strategy to evaluate the player's hand and the community board, considering the factors mentioned above. The assistant should also be able to identify and avoid common mistakes, such as calling with a weak hand or folding a strong hand.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\nThe assistant's response will be evaluated based on the correctness of the action and the quality of the reasoning. The assistant should provide a clear and concise explanation of the thought process behind the action, including the factors considered and the decision made.\n\n## Example Inputs and Feedback\nThe following examples demonstrate the input format and the expected output:\n```\n# Example 1\n## Inputs\n### personality\nnine_percent\n\n### hole_cards\n(8c, Jc)\n\n### board\n(Qc, 6d, Th, 4s)\n\n### street\nTurn\n\n## Generated Outputs\n### reasoning\nWith a turn street and a board of Qc, 6d, Th, 4s, I have a possible flush draw with my hole cards 8c and Jc. However, the board also has a possible straight draw and a weak top pair for a possible straight. Given my aggressive personality, I should consider raising to protect my hand and potentially build the pot.\n\n### action\nraise\n\n## Feedback\nYou made the incorrect 'call' action for this hand and board.

However, the board also has a possible flush draw with the 6d and the Qc, so I'll need to be cautious.

The decision tree should take into account the following factors:\n- The player's personality and how it affects their betting and folding behavior.\n- The strength of the hand, including the presence of pairs, flush draws, and strong hands.\n- The current state of the game, including the street and the board cards.\n- The possibility of improving the hand with the next card.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\nThe assistant's responses will be evaluated based on their accuracy and the reasoning provided. The assistant should provide a clear and concise explanation of their decision, including the factors that led to their conclusion.\n\n## Example Inputs and Outputs\nThe following are examples of input and output for the task:\n```\n# Example 1\n## Inputs\n### personality\nnine_percent\n\n### hole_cards\n(6h, 9h)\n\n### board\n(Td, 5c, Kd, 9s, 6c)\n\n### street\nRiver\n\n## Generated Outputs\n### reasoning\nI'm a nine_percent player, so I'll be playing fairly tight. Given that the board has paired on the river and I have a pair of sixes and a pair of nines, I have a strong hand. However, the board also has a ten and a king, which could be part of a stronger hand. I'll need to consider the possibility that my opponent has a stronger hand and decide whether to bet or check.\n\n### action\ncall\n\n## Feedback\nYou made the correct 'call' action for this hand and board.

With a strong Ace-high hand and a possible flush draw, I need to consider my opponent's possible actions. Since it's the Turn, my opponent may be trying to trap me or build a strong hand. However, my hand is still quite strong, and I have a good chance of winning if I can get a good price.\n\n### action\ncall\n\n## Feedback\nYou made the incorrect 'call' action for this hand and board. The correct action is 'fold'.

Given that I have a pair of Queens (Qc, 3c) and the board is (Qs, 4d, Tc, Qd, 3s), I have a strong hand. The river has not improved my hand, so I should be cautious not to overplay my hand.

The inputs include the player's personality, hole cards, board cards, and the current street.\n\n## Input Format\nThe input format is as follows:\n- `personality`: A string representing the player's personality, such as 'nine_percent'.\n- `hole_cards`: A tuple of two strings representing the player's hole cards, e.g., `(5c, 4d)`.\n- `board`: A tuple of five strings representing the community board cards, e.g., `(Qc, 4c, Ad)`.\n- `street`: A string representing the current street, e.g., 'Flop', 'Turn', or 'River'.\n\n## Task Requirements\nThe assistant should analyze the inputs and determine the best action for the player based on their personality and the given hand. The action can be one of the following:\n- `check`\n- `bet`\n- `raise`\n- `call`\n- `fold`\n- `all_in`\n\n## Domain-Specific Factual Information\n- A 'nine_percent' player is a tight-aggressive player who plays fairly tight and only bets/raises with strong hands.\n- A flush draw is a possible hand when a player has four cards of the same suit and the fifth card on the board is also of the same suit.\n- A straight draw is a possible hand when a player has five cards in sequential order, but one card is missing.\n- A pair is a hand when a player has two cards of the same rank.\n- A set is a hand when a player has three cards of the same rank.\n- A King kicker is a hand when a player has a pair and a King as the highest card.\n\n## Generalizable Strategy\nThe assistant should use a decision tree or a similar strategy to determine the best action based on the player's personality and the given hand. The strategy should consider the following factors:\n- The player's personality and their corresponding playing style.\n- The strength of the player's hand, including the presence of a pair, set, or straight draw.\n- The presence of possible draws, such as a flush draw or a straight draw.\n- The current street and the number of community cards remaining.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\nThe assistant's response will be evaluated based on the correctness of the action and the quality of the reasoning provided. The feedback will include suggestions for improvement and additional information to consider.\n\n## Example Inputs and Feedback\nThe following are examples of different task inputs provided to the assistant along with the assistant's response for each of them, and some feedback on how the assistant's response could be better:\n```\n# Example 1\n## Inputs\n### personality\nnine_percent\n\n### hole_cards\n(5c, 4d)\n\n### board\n(Qc, 4c, Ad)\n\n### street\nFlop\n\n## Generated Outputs\n### reasoning\nI'm a nine_percent player, so I'll be playing fairly tight. On the flop, I have a possible flush draw with my 4d and the 4c on the board. However, the Ad on the board also gives me a possible straight draw. Given my tight image, I don't want to get too aggressive, but I also don't want to give up my potential hand.\n\n### action\ncall\n\n## Feedback\nYou made the incorrect 'call' action for this hand and board.

I have a relatively strong hand with a pair of sevens (7h, 9s) and the board has a set of sevens (7d, 5s, 6d, 7c, 5h). However, the board also has two fives, which could be a possible draw for my opponent. Considering my aggressive nature, I want to maximize my potential winnings, but I also need to be cautious of the possible draw.\n\n### action\ncall\n\n## Feedback\nYou made the incorrect 'call' action for this hand and board.

The decision tree should take into account the following factors:\n- The player's personality and how it affects their betting and folding behavior.\n- The strength of the hand, including the presence of pairs, flush draws, and strong hands.\n- The current state of the game, including the street and the board cards.\n- The possibility of improving the hand with the next card.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\nThe assistant's responses will be evaluated based on their accuracy and the reasoning provided. The assistant should provide a clear and concise explanation of their decision, including the factors that led to their conclusion.\n\n## Example Inputs and Outputs\nThe following are examples of input and output for the task:\n```\n# Example 1\n## Inputs\n### personality\nnine_percent\n\n### hole_cards\n(6h, 9h)\n\n### board\n(Td, 5c, Kd, 9s, 6c)\n\n### street\nRiver\n\n## Generated Outputs\n### reasoning\nI'm a nine_percent player, so I'll be playing fairly tight. Given that the board has paired on the river and I have a pair of sixes and a pair of nines, I have a strong hand. However, the board also has a ten and a king, which could be part of a stronger hand. I'll need to consider the possibility that my opponent has a stronger hand and decide whether to bet or check.\n\n### action\ncall\n\n## Feedback\nYou made the correct 'call' action for this hand and board. This correct action is indeed 'call'.\n\n# Example 2\n## Inputs\n### personality\nnine_percent\n\n### hole_cards\n(Qc, Ah)\n\n### board\n(5s, 7h, 9s, 4h)\n\n### street\nTurn\n\n## Generated Outputs\n### reasoning\nI'm a nine_percent player, so I'll be playing fairly tight. With a strong Ace-high hand and a possible flush draw, I need to consider my opponent's possible actions. Since it's the Turn, my opponent may be trying to trap me or build a strong hand. However, my hand is still quite strong, and I have a good chance of winning if I can get a good price.\n\n### action\ncall\n\n## Feedback\nYou made the incorrect 'call' action for this hand and board. The correct action is 'fold'. Think about how you could have reasoned to make the correct decision with you hand and the board cards.\n\n# Example 3\n## Inputs\n### personality\nnine_percent\n\n### hole_cards\n(Qc, 3c)\n\n### board\n(Qs, 4d, Tc, Qd, 3s)\n\n### street\nRiver\n\n## Generated Outputs\n### reasoning\nI'm a nine_percent player, which means I'm a tight-aggressive player. Given that I have a pair of Queens (Qc, 3c) and the board is (Qs, 4d, Tc, Qd, 3s), I have a strong hand. The river has not improved my hand, so I should be cautious not to overplay my hand. However, since I have a strong hand and my opponent may have a weaker hand, I should aim to maximize my winnings.\n\n### action\ncall\n\n## Feedback\nYou made the incorrect 'call' action for this hand and board.

The inputs include the player's personality, hole cards, board cards, and the current street.\n\n## Input Format\nThe input format is as follows:\n- `personality`: A string representing the player's personality, such as 'nine_percent'.\n- `hole_cards`: A tuple of two strings representing the player's hole cards, e.g., `(Ts, 5h)`.\n- `board`: A tuple of five strings representing the community board cards, e.g., `(5c, 6d, Kd, 3c, 6c)`.\n- `street`: A string representing the current street, e.g., 'Flop', 'Turn', or 'River'.\n\n## Task Requirements\nThe assistant should analyze the inputs and determine the best action for the player based on their personality and the given hand. The action can be one of the following:\n- `check`\n- `bet`\n- `raise`\n- `call`\n- `fold`\n- `all_in`\n\n## Domain-Specific Factual Information\n- A 'nine_percent' player is a tight-aggressive player who plays fairly tight and only bets/raises with strong hands.\n- A flush draw is a possible hand when a player has four cards of the same suit and the fifth card on the board is also of the same suit.\n- A straight draw is a possible hand when a player has five cards in sequential order, but one card is missing.\n- A pair is a hand when a player has two cards of the same rank.\n- A set is a hand when a player has three cards of the same rank.\n- A King kicker is a hand when a player has a pair and a King as the highest card.\n- A possible draw is a situation where a player has a hand that could improve to a stronger hand with the next community card.\n- A tight-aggressive player is a player who plays fairly tight and only bets/raises with strong hands.\n\n## Generalizable Strategy\nThe assistant should use a decision tree or a similar strategy to determine the best action based on the player's personality and the given hand. The strategy should consider the following factors:\n- The player's personality and their corresponding playing style.\n- The strength of the player's hand, including the presence of a pair, set, or straight draw.\n- The presence of possible draws, such as a flush draw or a straight draw.\n- The current street and the number of community cards remaining.\n- The potential hand strength of the opponent based on the community cards.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\nThe assistant's response will be evaluated based on the correctness of the action and the quality of the reasoning provided.

Think about how you could have reasoned to make the correct decision with you hand and the board cards.\n\n\n\n# Example 2\n## Inputs\n### personality\nnine_percent\n\n### hole_cards\n(Tc, Ah)\n\n### board\n(2h, 7d, 2c, 5s, Ac)\n\n### street\nRiver\n\n## Generated Outputs\n### reasoning\nI'm a nine_percent player, which means I'm a tight-aggressive player. On the River, I have a strong hand with a high Ace (Ah) and a possible straight draw with my Tc and the 7d on the board. However, the board also has two 2s, which could be a possible draw for my opponent. Considering my aggressive nature, I want to maximize my potential winnings, but I also need to be cautious of the possible draw.\n\n### action\ncall\n\n## Feedback\nYou made the correct 'call' action for this hand and board.
