A player should consider the pot odds when deciding whether to call or raise.\n- In general, a player should aim to maximize their expected value by choosing the action that results in the highest expected winnings.\n\n## Generalizable Strategy\nThe assistant should use a decision-making framework that takes into account the player's personality, the strength of their hand, the board cards, and the current street. The framework should consider the following factors:\n- The player's personality and playing style\n- The strength of the player's hand (e.g., weak, strong, draw)\n- The board cards and their potential to improve the player's hand\n- The current street and the potential for future draws or improvements\n- The pot odds and the potential for maximizing expected value\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\nThe assistant's response will be evaluated based on the correctness of the recommended action, the clarity and coherence of the reasoning, and the ability to adapt to different input scenarios.\n\n## Example Inputs and Feedback\nThe following examples demonstrate the input format and the expected output:\n```\n# Example 1\n## Inputs\n### personality\ntwenty_percent\n\n### hole_cards\n(6s, 7s)\n\n### board\n()\n\n### street\nPreflop\n\n## Generated Outputs\n### reasoning\nIt's preflop and I have a weak hand with a possible draw. I should be cautious and not commit too much chips.\n\n### action\nfold\n\n## Feedback\nYou made the correct 'fold' action for this hand and board. This correct action is indeed 'fold'.\n\n# Example 2\n## Inputs\n### personality\ntwenty_percent\n\n### hole_cards\n(9d, Tc)\n\n### board\n(Ad, Qh, Kd, Qd, As)\n\n### street\nRiver\n\n## Generated Outputs\n### reasoning\nWith a twenty_percent personality, I'm looking to play aggressively but also be mindful of the pot odds. On the River, I have a pair of Queens with a possible flush draw. Given the board's strength and my hand's potential, I should consider raising to maximize my winnings.\n\n### action\nraise\n\n## Feedback\nYou made the incorrect 'raise' action for this hand and board. The correct action is 'fold'. Think about how you could have reasoned to make the correct decision with your hand and the board cards.\n\n# Example 3\n## Inputs\n### personality\ntwenty_percent\n\n### hole_cards\n(2h, 7c)\n\n### board\n(6s, 7d, 5h, Jh, 3s)\n\n### street\nRiver\n\n## Generated Outputs\n### reasoning\nI'm a twenty_percent player, which means I'm a tight player who only plays strong hands. I have a hand of 2h, 7c, which is a weak hand, but it's paired with the 7d on the board. This gives me a pair of sevens, which is a decent hand. However, the board also has a possible flush draw with the 6s, 5h, and Jh, and a straight draw with the 5h and Jh. Considering my tight playing style, I should be cautious and not get too aggressive.\n\n### action\ncheck\n\n## Feedback\nYou made the incorrect 'check' action for this hand and board. The correct action is 'fold'. Think about how you could have reasoned to make the correct decision with your hand and the board cards."

A player should consider the pot odds when deciding whether to call or raise.\n- In general, a player should aim to maximize their expected value by choosing the action that results in the highest expected winnings.\n\n## Generalizable Strategy\nThe assistant should use a decision-making framework that takes into account the player's personality, the strength of their hand, the board cards, and the current street. The framework should consider the following factors:\n- The player's personality and playing style\n- The strength of the player's hand (e.g., weak, strong, draw)\n- The board cards and their potential to improve the player's hand\n- The current street and the potential for future draws or improvements\n- The pot odds and the potential for maximizing expected value\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\nThe assistant's response will be evaluated based on the correctness of the recommended action, the clarity and coherence of the reasoning, and the ability to adapt to different input scenarios.\n\n## Example Inputs and Feedback\nThe following examples demonstrate the input format and the expected output:\n```\n# Example 1\n## Inputs\n### personality\ntwenty_percent\n\n### hole_cards\n(6s, 7s)\n\n### board\n()\n\n### street\nPreflop\n\n## Generated Outputs\n### reasoning\nIt's preflop and I have a weak hand with a possible draw. I should be cautious and not commit too much chips.\n\n### action\nfold\n\n## Feedback\nYou made the correct 'fold' action for this hand and board. This correct action is indeed 'fold'.\n\n# Example 2\n## Inputs\n### personality\ntwenty_percent\n\n### hole_cards\n(9d, Tc)\n\n### board\n(Ad, Qh, Kd, Qd, As)\n\n### street\nRiver\n\n## Generated Outputs\n### reasoning\nWith a twenty_percent personality, I'm looking to play aggressively but also be mindful of the pot odds. On the River, I have a pair of Queens with a possible flush draw. Given the board's strength and my hand's potential, I should consider raising to maximize my winnings.\n\n### action\nraise\n\n## Feedback\nYou made the incorrect 'raise' action for this hand and board. The correct action is 'fold'. Think about how you could have reasoned to make the correct decision with your hand and the board cards.\n\n# Example 3\n## Inputs\n### personality\ntwenty_percent\n\n### hole_cards\n(2h, 7c)\n\n### board\n(6s, 7d, 5h, Jh, 3s)\n\n### street\nRiver\n\n## Generated Outputs\n### reasoning\nI'm a twenty_percent player, which means I'm a tight player who only plays strong hands. I have a hand of 2h, 7c, which is a weak hand, but it's paired with the 7d on the board. This gives me a pair of sevens, which is a decent hand. However, the board also has a possible flush draw with the 6s, 5h, and Jh, and a straight draw with the 5h and Jh. Considering my tight playing style, I should be cautious and not get too aggressive.\n\n### action\ncheck\n\n## Feedback\nYou made the incorrect 'check' action for this hand and board. The correct action is 'fold'. Think about how you could have reasoned to make the correct decision with your hand and the board cards."

The assistant should use a decision-making framework that takes into account the player's personality, the strength of their hand, the board cards, and the current street.\n\n## Input Format\nThe input will be a dictionary containing the following keys:\n- `personality`: a string representing the player's personality (e.g., 'twenty_percent')\n- `hole_cards`: a tuple of two strings representing the player's hole cards (e.g., ('6s', '7s'))\n- `board`: a tuple of five strings representing the community board cards (e.g., ('Ad', 'Qh', 'Kd', 'Qd', 'As'))\n- `street`: a string representing the current street (e.g., 'Preflop', 'Flop', 'Turn', 'River')\n\n## Task Objective\nThe objective is to generate a recommendation for the best action (e.g., 'fold', 'call', 'raise', 'check') based on the input parameters.\n\n## Domain-Specific Factual Information\n- In Poker, a 'twenty_percent' personality refers to a tight-aggressive playing style, where the player only plays strong hands and aims to maximize their winnings.\n- A 'weak hand' is typically defined as a hand with a low ranking or a hand that is unlikely to win against other players.\n- A 'draw' refers to a situation where a player has a chance to improve their hand by making a specific card on the board.\n- The 'pot odds' refer to the ratio of the current pot size to the cost of calling a bet. A player should consider the pot odds when deciding whether to call or raise.\n- In general, a player should aim to maximize their expected value by choosing the action that results in the highest expected winnings.\n- A 'flush draw' occurs when a player has a hand with a possible flush, and a 'straight draw' occurs when a player has a hand with a possible straight.\n- A 'pair' is a hand with two cards of the same rank, and a 'strong hand' is typically defined as a hand with a high ranking or a hand that is likely to win against other players.\n- In Poker, the 'River' is the final community card dealt in a round, and it is the last opportunity for players to improve their hand.\n- A 'tight player' is a player who only plays strong hands, and an 'aggressive player' is a player who plays a lot of hands and bets frequently.\n\n## Generalizable Strategy\nThe assistant should use a decision-making framework that takes into account the player's personality, the strength of their hand, the board cards, and the current street. The framework should consider the following factors:\n- The player's personality and playing style\n- The strength of the player's hand (e.g., weak, strong, draw)\n- The board cards and their potential to improve the player's hand\n- The current street and the potential for future draws or improvements\n- The pot odds and the potential for maximizing expected value\n- The presence of a flush draw or a straight draw\n- The presence of a pair or a strong hand\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\nThe assistant's response will be evaluated based on the correctness of the recommended action, the clarity and coherence of the reasoning, and the ability to adapt to different input scenarios.\n\n## Example Inputs and Feedback\nThe following examples demonstrate the input format and the expected output:\n```\n# Example 1\n## Inputs\n### personality\ntwenty_percent\n\n### hole_cards\n(3c, Qc)\n\n### board\n(5d, Ks, Ad, Js, 8d)\n\n### street\nRiver\n\n## Generated Outputs\n### reasoning\nI'm a twenty_percent player, which means I'm a tight player who only plays strong hands. On the River, I have a hand of 3c, Qc, which is a decent hand with a possible flush draw. However, the board also has a possible flush draw with the Js and a straight draw with the Ad and Js.

Given the hole cards (8d, 7d) and the current board (Qh, 4c, Kh, Ad), I do not have a strong hand. The board has a possible flush draw for hearts, but my hand does not participate in it. I will fold to minimize losses.\n\n### action\nfold\n\n## Feedback\nYou made the correct \'fold\' action for this hand and board.

Given my hole cards (7c, 3s) and the current board (6d, Ah, 8s, 3h), I have a possible pair with the 3s, but it\'s not yet a strong hand. The turn street is a good opportunity to see how opponents react, so I\'ll check to gather more information.\n\n### action\ncheck\n\n## Feedback\nYou made the incorrect \'check\' action for this hand and board.

A player should consider the pot odds when deciding whether to call or raise.\n- In general, a player should aim to maximize their expected value by choosing the action that results in the highest expected winnings.\n\n## Generalizable Strategy\nThe assistant should use a decision-making framework that takes into account the player's personality, the strength of their hand, the board cards, and the current street. The framework should consider the following factors:\n- The player's personality and playing style\n- The strength of the player's hand (e.g., weak, strong, draw)\n- The board cards and their potential to improve the player's hand\n- The current street and the potential for future draws or improvements\n- The pot odds and the potential for maximizing expected value\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\nThe assistant's response will be evaluated based on the correctness of the recommended action, the clarity and coherence of the reasoning, and the ability to adapt to different input scenarios.\n\n## Example Inputs and Feedback\nThe following examples demonstrate the input format and the expected output:\n```\n# Example 1\n## Inputs\n### personality\ntwenty_percent\n\n### hole_cards\n(6s, 7s)\n\n### board\n()\n\n### street\nPreflop\n\n## Generated Outputs\n### reasoning\nIt's preflop and I have a weak hand with a possible draw.

I have a hand of 2h, 7c, which is a weak hand, but it's paired with the 7d on the board. This gives me a pair of sevens, which is a decent hand. However, the board also has a possible flush draw with the 6s, 5h, and Jh, and a straight draw with the 5h and Jh. Considering my tight playing style, I should be cautious and not get too aggressive.\n\n### action\ncheck\n\n## Feedback\nYou made the incorrect 'check' action for this hand and board.

A player should consider the pot odds when deciding whether to call or raise.\n- In general, a player should aim to maximize their expected value by choosing the action that results in the highest expected winnings.\n\n## Generalizable Strategy\nThe assistant should use a decision-making framework that takes into account the player's personality, the strength of their hand, the board cards, and the current street. The framework should consider the following factors:\n- The player's personality and playing style\n- The strength of the player's hand (e.g., weak, strong, draw)\n- The board cards and their potential to improve the player's hand\n- The current street and the potential for future draws or improvements\n- The pot odds and the potential for maximizing expected value\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\nThe assistant's response will be evaluated based on the correctness of the recommended action, the clarity and coherence of the reasoning, and the ability to adapt to different input scenarios.\n\n## Example Inputs and Feedback\nThe following examples demonstrate the input format and the expected output:\n```\n# Example 1\n## Inputs\n### personality\ntwenty_percent\n\n### hole_cards\n(6s, 7s)\n\n### board\n()\n\n### street\nPreflop\n\n## Generated Outputs\n### reasoning\nIt's preflop and I have a weak hand with a possible draw.

This correct action is indeed 'fold'.\n\n# Example 2\n## Inputs\n### personality\ntwenty_percent\n\n### hole_cards\n(9d, Tc)\n\n### board\n(Ad, Qh, Kd, Qd, As)\n\n### street\nRiver\n\n## Generated Outputs\n### reasoning\nWith a twenty_percent personality, I'm looking to play aggressively but also be mindful of the pot odds. On the River, I have a pair of Queens with a possible flush draw. Given the board's strength and my hand's potential, I should consider raising to maximize my winnings.\n\n### action\nraise\n\n## Feedback\nYou made the incorrect 'raise' action for this hand and board. The correct action is 'fold'. Think about how you could have reasoned to make the correct decision with your hand and the board cards.\n\n# Example 3\n## Inputs\n### personality\ntwenty_percent\n\n### hole_cards\n(2h, 7c)\n\n### board\n(6s, 7d, 5h, Jh, 3s)\n\n### street\nRiver\n\n## Generated Outputs\n### reasoning\nI'm a twenty_percent player, which means I'm a tight player who only plays strong hands. I have a hand of 2h, 7c, which is a weak hand, but it's paired with the 7d on the board. This gives me a pair of sevens, which is a decent hand. However, the board also has a possible flush draw with the 6s, 5h, and Jh, and a straight draw with the 5h and Jh. Considering my tight playing style, I should be cautious and not get too aggressive.\n\n### action\ncheck\n\n## Feedback\nYou made the incorrect 'check' action for this hand and board.

The framework should consider the following factors:\n- The player's personality and playing style\n- The strength of the player's hand (e.g., weak, strong, draw)\n- The board cards and their potential to improve the player's hand\n- The current street and the potential for future draws or improvements\n- The pot odds and the potential for maximizing expected value\n- The player's position at the table and the potential for future actions by other players\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\nThe assistant's response will be evaluated based on the correctness of the recommended action, the clarity and coherence of the reasoning, and the ability to adapt to different input scenarios.\n\n## Example Inputs and Feedback\nThe following examples demonstrate the input format and the expected output:\n```\n# Example 1\n## Inputs\n### personality\ntwenty_percent\n\n### hole_cards\n(8s, 8h)\n\n### board\n(Ks, 2d, 2h, 8d, 5h)\n\n### street\nRiver\n\n## Generated Outputs\n### reasoning\nI'm a twenty_percent player, which means I'm a tight player who only plays strong hands. I have a hand of 8s, 8h, which is a strong hand with a pair of eights. The board has a possible flush draw with the Ks and 5h, but my hand is still strong. Considering my tight playing style, I should be cautious and not get too aggressive, but I also don't want to fold a strong hand. Given the board's strength and my hand's potential, I should consider checking to see how the other players react.\n\n### action\ncheck\n\n## Feedback\nYou made the incorrect 'check' action for this hand and board. The correct action is 'all_in'. Think about how you could have reasoned to make the correct decision with you hand and the board cards.\n\n\n\n# Example 2\n## Inputs\n### personality\ntwenty_percent\n\n### hole_cards\n(9c, 7c)\n\n### board\n(Kc, 4d, Js, 6d, 8c)\n\n### street\nRiver\n\n## Generated Outputs\n### reasoning\nI'm a twenty_percent player, which means I'm a tight player who only plays strong hands. On the River, I have a hand of 9c, 7c, which is a weak hand. The board has a possible flush draw with the Js and 6d, and a straight draw with the Js and 4d. Considering my tight playing style, I should be cautious and not get too aggressive. Given the strength of the board and the potential for a stronger hand, I should fold to minimize my losses.\n\n### action\nfold\n\n## Feedback\nYou made the correct 'fold' action for this hand and board. This correct action is indeed 'fold.'\n\n\n\n# Example 3\n## Inputs\n### personality\ntwenty_percent\n\n### hole_cards\n(9h, 7c)\n\n### board\n(Kc, 4c, As, 8c, Th)\n\n### street\nRiver\n\n## Generated Outputs\n### reasoning\nI'm a twenty_percent player, which means I'm a tight player who only plays strong hands. On the River, I have a hand of 9h, 7c, which is a strong hand with a possible straight draw. However, the board also has a possible flush draw with the Kc, 4c, and 8c, and a straight draw with the 4c and 8c. Considering my tight playing style, I should be cautious and not get too aggressive. Given the strength of my hand and the potential for future draws, I should consider calling to see if I can improve my hand.\n\n### action\ncall\n\n## Feedback\nYou made the incorrect 'call' action for this hand and board. The correct action is 'fold'. Think about how you could have reasoned to make the correct decision with you hand and the board cards.\n```\n\n## Task Objective\nThe objective is to generate a recommendation for the best action (e.g., 'fold', 'call', 'raise', 'check', 'all_in') based on the input parameters.\n\n## Additional Requirements\n- The assistant should be able to handle different input scenarios, including different personalities, hole cards, board cards, and streets.\n- The assistant should be able to adapt to different playing styles and strategies.\n- The assistant should be able to provide clear and concise reasoning for its recommended action."

I have a hand of 8s, 8h, which is a strong hand with a pair of eights. The board has a possible flush draw with the Ks and 5h, but my hand is still strong. Considering my tight playing style, I should be cautious and not get too aggressive, but I also don't want to fold a strong hand. Given the board's strength and my hand's potential, I should consider checking to see how the other players react.\n\n### action\ncheck\n\n## Feedback\nYou made the incorrect 'check' action for this hand and board.

On the River, I have a hand of 9c, 7c, which is a weak hand. The board has a possible flush draw with the Js and 6d, and a straight draw with the Js and 4d. Considering my tight playing style, I should be cautious and not get too aggressive. Given the strength of the board and the potential for a stronger hand, I should fold to minimize my losses.\n\n### action\nfold\n\n## Feedback\nYou made the correct 'fold' action for this hand and board.

The inputs will include the player's personality, hole cards, the current state of the board, and the current street (e.g., preflop, flop, turn, river). The assistant should consider the player's personality, the strength of the hole cards, the current state of the board, and the current street to make an informed decision.\n\n## Input Format\nThe inputs will be in the following format:\n- personality: A string describing the player's personality (e.g., twenty_percent, tight_aggressive, loose_passive)\n- hole_cards: A tuple of two strings representing the player's hole cards (e.g., (6d, Ah))\n- board: A tuple of strings representing the current state of the board (e.g., ())\n- street: A string describing the current street (e.g., preflop, flop, turn, river)\n\n## Task Requirements\nThe assistant should provide a clear and concise reasoning for the determined action. The reasoning should take into account the player's personality, the strength of the hole cards, the current state of the board, and the current street. The assistant should also consider the following domain-specific information:\n- In Poker, the goal is to win the pot by making the best five-card hand possible.\n- The player's personality will influence their decision-making process:\n  - twenty_percent players are relatively passive and aim to minimize their losses.\n  - tight_aggressive players are selective with their starting hands and aim to maximize their winnings.\n  - loose_passive players are more aggressive but tend to fold weak hands.\n- The strength of the hole cards will impact the player's decision:\n  - Strong hands (e.g., high pairs, high cards) should be played aggressively.\n  - Weak hands (e.g., low cards, unconnected cards) should be played conservatively.\n- The current state of the board will impact the player's decision:\n  - A blank board (no community cards) means the player has more information about their hole cards.\n  - A board with community cards means the player has less information about their hole cards.\n- The current street will impact the player's decision:\n  - Preflop: The player has not seen any community cards yet.\n  - Flop: The player has seen three community cards.\n  - Turn: The player has seen four community cards.\n  - River: The player has seen five community cards.\n\n## Generalizable Strategy\nThe assistant should use a decision tree or a similar approach to determine the best action based on the inputs. The decision tree should consider the player's personality, the strength of the hole cards, the current state of the board, and the current street.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\nThe assistant's responses will be evaluated based on the following criteria:\n- Correctness: Is the determined action correct based on the inputs?\n- Reasoning: Is the provided reasoning clear and concise?\n- Generalizability: Does the assistant's approach generalize to different inputs and scenarios?\n\n## Additional Requirements\n- The assistant should be able to handle different types of hole cards (e.g., high cards, low cards, pairs, unconnected cards).\n- The assistant should be able to handle different types of boards (e.g., blank board, board with community cards).\n- The assistant should be able to handle different streets (e.g., preflop, flop, turn, river).\n- The assistant should be able to provide a clear and concise explanation for their decision.\n\n## Example Inputs and Feedback\nThe following are examples of different task inputs provided to the assistant along with the assistant's response for each of them, and some feedback on how the assistant's response could be better:\n```\n# Example 1\n## Inputs\n### personality\ntwenty_percent\n\n### hole_cards\n(6h, 2h)\n\n### board\n()\n\n### street\nPreflop\n\n## Generated Outputs\n### reasoning\nAs a twenty_percent player, I aim to minimize my losses. With a weak hand of 6h and 2h, preflop, I should be cautious and fold to avoid losing more chips.\n\n### action\nfold\n\n## Feedback\nYou made the correct 'fold' action for this hand and board. This correct action is indeed 'fold.'\n\n# Example 2\n## Inputs\n### personality\ntwenty_percent\n\n### hole_cards\n(7d, 9c)\n\n### board\n()\n\n### street\nPreflop\n\n## Generated Outputs\n### reasoning\nAs a twenty_percent player, I aim to minimize my losses. With a relatively weak hand of 7d and 9c preflop, I should be cautious and fold to avoid losing more chips.\n\n### action\nfold\n\n## Feedback\nYou made the incorrect 'fold' action for this hand and board. The correct action is 'check'. Think about how you could have reasoned to make the correct decision with you hand and the board cards.\n\n# Example 3\n## Inputs\n### personality\ntwenty_percent\n\n### hole_cards\n(Th, 3h)\n\n### board\n()\n\n### street\nPreflop\n\n## Generated Outputs\n### reasoning\nAs a twenty_percent player, I aim to minimize my losses. With a relatively weak hand of (Th, 3h) preflop, it's best to be cautious and fold to avoid losing more chips.\n\n### action\nfold\n\n## Feedback\nYou made the incorrect 'fold' action for this hand and board. The correct action is 'check'. Think about how you could have reasoned to make the correct decision with you hand and the board cards.\n```\n\n## Task Solution\nThe task solution should be able to handle the following scenarios:\n- A twenty_percent player with a weak hand preflop should fold.\n- A twenty_percent player with a relatively weak hand preflop should check.\n- A tight_aggressive player with a strong hand preflop should raise.\n- A loose_passive player with a weak hand preflop should call.\n- A loose_passive player with a strong hand preflop should raise.\n\nThe task solution should be able to provide a clear and concise explanation for their decision.\n\n## Evaluation Metrics\nThe task solution will be evaluated based on the following metrics:\n- Accuracy: The task solution should be able to make accurate decisions based on the inputs.\n- Reasoning: The task solution should be able to provide clear and concise explanations for their decisions.\n- Generalizability: The task solution should be able to generalize to different inputs and scenarios.\n\n## Future Work\nThe task solution can be improved by:\n- Adding more scenarios to the decision tree.\n- Improving the reasoning and explanation provided by the task solution.\n- Adding more evaluation metrics to evaluate the task solution."

A player should consider the pot odds when deciding whether to call or raise.\n- In general, a player should aim to maximize their expected value by choosing the action that results in the highest expected winnings.\n- A 'strong hand' is typically defined as a hand with a high ranking or a hand that is likely to win against other players.\n- A 'flush draw' refers to a situation where a player has a chance to make a flush by making a specific card on the board.\n- A 'straight draw' refers to a situation where a player has a chance to make a straight by making a specific card on the board.\n- A 'pair' refers to a hand with two cards of the same rank.\n- A 'kicker' refers to a card that is used to break a tie when two or more players have the same hand rank.\n\n## Generalizable Strategy\nThe assistant should use a decision-making framework that takes into account the player's personality, the strength of their hand, the board cards, and the current street. The framework should consider the following factors:\n- The player's personality and playing style\n- The strength of the player's hand (e.g., weak, strong, draw)\n- The board cards and their potential to improve the player's hand\n- The current street and the potential for future draws or improvements\n- The pot odds and the potential for maximizing expected value\n- The presence of a flush draw or straight draw on the board\n- The presence of a pair or kicker in the player's hand\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\nThe assistant's response will be evaluated based on the correctness of the recommended action, the clarity and coherence of the reasoning, and the ability to adapt to different input scenarios.\n\n## Example Inputs and Feedback\nThe following examples demonstrate the input format and the expected output:\n```\n# Example 1\n## Inputs\n### personality\ntwenty_percent\n\n### hole_cards\n(Qh, 9s)\n\n### board\n(Qc, Qs, 4d, 8h, Kd)\n\n### street\nRiver\n\n## Generated Outputs\n### reasoning\nI'm a twenty_percent player, which means I'm a tight player who only plays strong hands. On the River, I have a hand of Qh, 9s, which is a strong hand with a possible flush draw. However, the board also has a possible flush draw with the Qc, Qs, and a strong kicker with the Kd. Considering my tight playing style, I should be cautious and not get too aggressive, but I should also consider the strength of my hand and the potential for a flush.\n\n### action\ncall\n\n## Feedback\nYou made the incorrect 'call' action for this hand and board. The correct action is 'all_in'. Think about how you could have reasoned to make the correct decision with you hand and the board cards.\n\n\n\n# Example 2\n## Inputs\n### personality\ntwenty_percent\n\n### hole_cards\n(9d, 6d)\n\n### board\n(5d, 6s, 8d, Th, 3s)\n\n### street\nRiver\n\n## Generated Outputs\n### reasoning\nI'm a twenty_percent player, which means I'm a tight player who only plays strong hands. However, with a hand of 9d, 6d, I have a weak hand with a possible draw to a straight with the 5d, 6s, and 8d on the board. Considering my tight playing style, I should be cautious and not get too aggressive.\n\n### action\nfold\n\n## Feedback\nYou made the correct 'fold' action for this hand and board.

A player should consider the pot odds when deciding whether to call or raise.\n- In general, a player should aim to maximize their expected value by choosing the action that results in the highest expected winnings.\n\n## Generalizable Strategy\nThe assistant should use a decision-making framework that takes into account the player's personality, the strength of their hand, the board cards, and the current street. The framework should consider the following factors:\n- The player's personality and playing style\n- The strength of the player's hand (e.g., weak, strong, draw)\n- The board cards and their potential to improve the player's hand\n- The current street and the potential for future draws or improvements\n- The pot odds and the potential for maximizing expected value\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\nThe assistant's response will be evaluated based on the correctness of the recommended action, the clarity and coherence of the reasoning, and the ability to adapt to different input scenarios.\n\n## Example Inputs and Feedback\nThe following examples demonstrate the input format and the expected output:\n```\n# Example 1\n## Inputs\n### personality\ntwenty_percent\n\n### hole_cards\n(6s, 7s)\n\n### board\n()\n\n### street\nPreflop\n\n## Generated Outputs\n### reasoning\nIt's preflop and I have a weak hand with a possible draw.

I have a hand of 2h, 7c, which is a weak hand, but it's paired with the 7d on the board. This gives me a pair of sevens, which is a decent hand. However, the board also has a possible flush draw with the 6s, 5h, and Jh, and a straight draw with the 5h and Jh. Considering my tight playing style, I should be cautious and not get too aggressive.\n\n### action\ncheck\n\n## Feedback\nYou made the incorrect 'check' action for this hand and board.

    instructions="python\n# Task Instruction\n\n## Task Description\nThe task is to determine the best action for a given Poker Hand, considering the player's personality, hole cards, board cards, and the current street. The assistant should use a decision-making framework that takes into account the player's personality, the strength of their hand, the board cards, and the current street.\n\n## Input Format\nThe input will be a dictionary containing the following keys:\n- `personality`: a string representing the player's personality (e.g., 'twenty_percent')\n- `hole_cards`: a tuple of two strings representing the player's hole cards (e.g., ('6s', '7s'))\n- `board`: a tuple of five strings representing the community board cards (e.g., ('Ad', 'Qh', 'Kd', 'Qd', 'As'))\n- `street`: a string representing the current street (e.g., 'Preflop', 'Flop', 'Turn', 'River')\n\n## Domain-Specific Factual Information\n- In Poker, a 'twenty_percent' personality refers to a tight-aggressive playing style, where the player only plays strong hands and aims to maximize their winnings.\n- A 'weak hand' is typically defined as a hand with a low ranking or a hand that is unlikely to win against other players.\n- A 'draw' refers to a situation where a player has a chance to improve their hand by making a specific card on the board.\n- The 'pot odds' refer to the ratio of the current pot size to the cost of calling a bet. A player should consider the pot odds when deciding whether to call or raise.\n- In general, a player should aim to maximize their expected value by choosing the action that results in the highest expected winnings.\n- A 'strong hand' is typically defined as a hand with a high ranking or a hand that is likely to win against other players.\n- A 'pair' refers to a hand with two cards of the same rank.\n- A 'flush draw' refers to a situation where a player has a chance to make a flush by making a specific card on the board.\n- A 'straight draw' refers to a situation where a player has a chance to make a straight by making a specific card on the board.\n- A 'tight player' is a player who only plays strong hands and aims to minimize their losses.\n- An 'aggressive player' is a player who plays a wide range of hands and aims to maximize their winnings.\n\n## Generalizable Strategy\nThe assistant should use a decision-making framework that takes into account the player's personality, the strength of their hand, the board cards, and the current street. The framework should consider the following factors:\n- The player's personality and playing style\n- The strength of the player's hand (e.g., weak, strong, draw)\n- The board cards and their potential to improve the player's hand\n- The current street and the potential for future draws or improvements\n- The pot odds and the potential for maximizing expected value\n- The player's position at the table and the potential for future actions by other players\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\nThe assistant's response will be evaluated based on the correctness of the recommended action, the clarity and coherence of the reasoning, and the ability to adapt to different input scenarios.\n\n## Example Inputs and Feedback\nThe following examples demonstrate the input format and the expected output:\n```\n# Example 1\n## Inputs\n### personality\ntwenty_percent\n\n### hole_cards\n(8s, 8h)\n\n### board\n(Ks, 2d, 2h, 8d, 5h)\n\n### street\nRiver\n\n## Generated Outputs\n### reasoning\nI'm a twenty_percent player, which means I'm a tight player who only plays strong hands. I have a hand of 8s, 8h, which is a strong hand with a pair of eights. The board has a possible flush draw with the Ks and 5h, but my hand is still strong. Considering my tight playing style, I should be cautious and not get too aggressive, but I also don't want to fold a strong hand. Given the board's strength and my hand's potential, I should consider checking to see how the other players react.\n\n### action\ncheck\n\n## Feedback\nYou made the incorrect 'check' action for this hand and board. The correct action is 'all_in'. Think about how you could have reasoned to make the correct decision with you hand and the board cards.\n\n\n\n# Example 2\n## Inputs\n### personality\ntwenty_percent\n\n### hole_cards\n(9c, 7c)\n\n### board\n(Kc, 4d, Js, 6d, 8c)\n\n### street\nRiver\n\n## Generated Outputs\n### reasoning\nI'm a twenty_percent player, which means I'm a tight player who only plays strong hands. On the River, I have a hand of 9c, 7c, which is a weak hand. The board has a possible flush draw with the Js and 6d, and a straight draw with the Js and 4d. Considering my tight playing style, I should be cautious and not get too aggressive. Given the strength of the board and the potential for a stronger hand, I should fold to minimize my losses.\n\n### action\nfold\n\n## Feedback\nYou made the correct 'fold' action for this hand and board. This correct action is indeed 'fold.'\n\n\n\n# Example 3\n## Inputs\n### personality\ntwenty_percent\n\n### hole_cards\n(9h, 7c)\n\n### board\n(Kc, 4c, As, 8c, Th)\n\n### street\nRiver\n\n## Generated Outputs\n### reasoning\nI'm a twenty_percent player, which means I'm a tight player who only plays strong hands. On the River, I have a hand of 9h, 7c, which is a strong hand with a possible straight draw. However, the board also has a possible flush draw with the Kc, 4c, and 8c, and a straight draw with the 4c and 8c. Considering my tight playing style, I should be cautious and not get too aggressive. Given the strength of my hand and the potential for future draws, I should consider calling to see if I can improve my hand.\n\n### action\ncall\n\n## Feedback\nYou made the incorrect 'call' action for this hand and board. The correct action is 'fold'. Think about how you could have reasoned to make the correct decision with you hand and the board cards.\n```\n\n## Task Objective\nThe objective is to generate a recommendation for the best action (e.g., 'fold', 'call', 'raise', 'check', 'all_in') based on the input parameters.\n\n## Additional Requirements\n- The assistant should be able to handle different input scenarios, including different personalities, hole cards, board cards, and streets.\n- The assistant should be able to adapt to different playing styles and strategies.\n- The assistant should be able to provide clear and concise reasoning for its recommended action."
