The assistant should consider the player's personality, the strength of their hand, the possible draws and board combinations, and the current street to make an informed decision.\n\n## Input Format\nThe input will be in the following format:\n- `personality`: A string representing the player's personality, e.g., `fifteen_percent`.\n- `hole_cards`: A tuple of two strings representing the player's hole cards, e.g., `(Kh, Kd)`.\n- `board`: A tuple of five strings representing the community board, e.g., `(Qh, 8h, 9s, Ac)`.\n- `street`: A string representing the current street, e.g., `Turn`.\n\n## Task Requirements\n1. The assistant should analyze the input hole cards and the community board to determine the strength of the player's hand.\n2. The assistant should consider the player's personality and adjust their strategy accordingly.\n3. The assistant should identify possible draws and board combinations that could improve or weaken the player's hand.\n4. The assistant should determine the best action based on the analysis, considering the current street and the player's hand strength.\n5. The assistant should provide a clear and concise reasoning for their decision.\n\n## Domain-Specific Factual Information\n- A pair of kings is a strong hand, but it can be vulnerable to ace-high flush draws.\n- A possible straight draw can be a strong hand, but it can also be vulnerable to flush draws.\n- A tight-aggressive player (15% aggression level) tends to be cautious and only play strong hands.\n- A player with a strong hand should consider raising to build the pot and protect their hand.\n- A player with a weak hand should consider folding to minimize losses.\n\n## Generalizable Strategies\n- Consider the player's personality and adjust their strategy accordingly.\n- Analyze the input hole cards and the community board to determine the strength of the player's hand.\n- Identify possible draws and board combinations that could improve or weaken the player's hand.\n- Determine the best action based on the analysis, considering the current street and the player's hand strength.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\nThe assistant's response will be evaluated based on the following criteria:\n- Accuracy: Is the assistant's action correct based on the input hand and board?\n- Reasoning: Is the assistant's reasoning clear and concise, and does it justify their action?\n- Adaptability: Does the assistant adjust their strategy based on the player's personality?\n- Domain knowledge: Does the assistant demonstrate a good understanding of poker concepts and strategies?"

For example, a "fifteen_percent" personality is likely to be aggressive and try to build the pot.\n- The hole cards: The player\'s hole cards will determine their hand strength and potential draws.\n- The board: The current state of the board will influence the player\'s hand strength and potential draws.\n- The street: The current street will determine the player\'s position in the game and their potential actions.\n\n## Domain-Specific Factual Information\n- A "straight draw" is a hand that has a chance to become a straight with the next card.\n- A "flush draw" is a hand that has a chance to become a flush with the next card.\n- "Top pair" refers to the highest pair on the board.\n- A player\'s personality can be classified as "aggressive" or "cautious" based on their betting style.\n\n## Generalizable Strategy\nThe assistant should use a decision-making framework that considers the player\'s personality, hole cards, board, and street to determine the best action. This framework should take into account the potential risks and rewards of each action and choose the one that maximizes the player\'s expected value.\n\n## Evaluation Criteria\nThe assistant\'s responses will be evaluated based on their accuracy and reasonableness. The feedback provided will help refine the assistant\'s decision-making framework and improve its performance over time.\n\n## Example Inputs and Feedback\nThe following are examples of different task inputs and feedback:\n```\n# Example 1\n## Inputs\n### personality\nfifteen_percent\n\n### hole_cards\n(7h, Jd)\n\n### board\n(6s, 4h, Ac, 2c)\n\n### street\nTurn\n\n## Generated Outputs\n### reasoning\nGiven the turn street and the board (6s, 4h, Ac, 2c), I have a possible straight draw with my hole cards (7h, Jd). However, the board also has a possible flush draw with the 6s, 4h, and 2c. Considering my personality is fifteen_percent, I\'m likely to be aggressive and try to build the pot.\n\n### action\nraise\n\n## Feedback\nYou made the incorrect \'raise\' action for this hand and board. The correct action is \'fold\'. Think about how you could have reasoned to make the correct decision with you hand and the board cards.\n\n\n\n# Example 2\n## Inputs\n### personality\nfifteen_percent\n\n### hole_cards\n(2s, 6h)\n\n### board\n(Td, 5s, Qh, As)\n\n### street\nTurn\n\n## Generated Outputs\n### reasoning\nGiven the hole cards (2s, 6h) and the board (Td, 5s, Qh, As), I\'m in a relatively weak hand with a possible draw to a straight. However, the turn card is a ten, which doesn\'t help my hand. Considering the opponent\'s possible actions and my fifteen percent personality, I should be cautious and not overplay my hand.\n\n### action\nfold\n\n## Feedback\nYou made the correct \'fold\' action for this hand and board. This correct action is indeed \'fold.\'\n\n\n\n# Example 3\n## Inputs\n### personality\nfifteen_percent\n\n### hole_cards\n(2s, Ts)\n\n### board\n(Qh, 9h, 9d, 4d)\n\n### street\nTurn\n\n## Generated Outputs\n### reasoning\nGiven the hole cards (2s, Ts) and the board (Qh, 9h, 9d, 4d) on the Turn street, I\'m looking for a possible flush draw with a straight draw. The top pair is a 9, but the flush draw is more likely to win.\n\n### action\ncall\n\n## Feedback\nYou made the incorrect \'call\' action for this hand and board. The correct action is \'fold\'. Think about how you could have reasoned to make the correct decision with you hand and the board cards.'

My opponent has not shown any aggression so far, and I'm playing tight. Considering my tight personality, I'm looking to minimize my losses and play cautiously.'\naction = 'check'\n```\n\nInput:\n```python\npersonality = 'fifteen_percent'\nhole_cards = ('Ts', '6d')\nboard = ('Kh', 'Jh', 'Ac')\nstreet = 'Flop'\n```\n\nOutput:\n```python\nreasoning = 'I'm a tight player, so I like to be selective with my hands. With a relatively weak hand of Ts and 6d, and the flop showing Kh, Jh, Ac, I don't have a strong hand. The king and jack are likely to be paired, and the ace could be a possible draw for someone with a strong ace. Given the strength of the board, I should be cautious and not commit too much.'\naction = 'fold'\n```\n\nInput:\n```python\npersonality = 'loose'\nhole_cards = ('4h', 'Th')\nboard = ('Ks', '9d', '3h')\nstreet = 'Flop'\n```\n\nOutput:\n```python\nreasoning = 'Given the flop board (Ks, 9d, 3h) and my hole cards (4h, Th), I have a weak hand with no clear connections to the board. The top pair is the King, which is not in my hand, and the 9 is in my hand but it's not a strong enough hand to bet aggressively.
